<p>“I think,” says Jowett, writing to John Addington
Symonds (August 4, 1890), “that you are happy in
having unlocked so much of Italian literature, certainly
the greatest in the world after Greek, Latin, English.
To have interpreted one such literature and made it
accessible to English-speaking people seems to me a
sufficient result of a life.”</p>

<p>It seems, however, peculiarly appropriate that a history
of Italian literature should follow and should precede
other and parallel histories. Symonds himself had long
before pointed out that no man, at least in a single
work of moderate compass, can fully deserve the credit
of having unlocked Italian literature. The study of
Italian letters, he had reminded us, cannot be profitably
pursued by itself. The literature of Italy requires to be
constantly considered in connection with other literatures,
both those from which it is itself derived, and
those which it has deeply influenced. It is more intimately
affiliated to antiquity than any other European
literature, and may indeed be regarded as a continuation
or revival of the Latin. Its advent was long and unaccountably
delayed&mdash;it is the youngest of all the chief
European literatures; but when at length it did appear,
its form, already classical, dispensed it from an infancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_i"></a>[Pg i]</span>
of rudeness and barbarism. It may be compared to
Hermes, the youngest but most precocious of the Gods;
not, like Pallas, born adult, but equal to any achievement
from the cradle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">

<p class="p1"><em>The babe was born at the first peep of day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He began playing on the lyre at noon;</span><br />
And the same evening did he steal away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Apollo’s herds.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Entering at once upon a heritage of classical tradition,
Italians began to teach foreign nations long before they
found anything to learn from them; and this influence
is so large a part of the glory of Italy that her literature
cannot be fully unlocked to the foreigner unless he is
shown, not only what she has herself effected in letters,
but how greatly she has modified the intellectual development
of other countries. She owes nothing to Chaucer,
Spenser, or Milton; but Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton
are infinitely indebted to her. The position she so long
retained as the instructor and exemplar of civilised
nations invests her literature with an importance more
considerable than that attaching to the merits of her
individual authors, illustrious as these are. Yet it is
impossible to elucidate this momentous department of
the subject in a manual of four hundred pages. All that
can be done is to indicate by continual reference and
allusion that the need exists, and must be satisfied elsewhere.
The influence upon Italy herself of foreign
writers, and of movements common to Europe in general,
has required and received fuller treatment.</p>

<p>Other circumstances, and these not attributable to the
restricted scale of his undertaking, conspire to afflict the
historian of Italian literature with a feeling of insufficiency.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[Pg ii]</span>
From causes which will appear in the course of this
history, many of the most gifted Italians wrote in Latin.
From Petrarch down to Nicius Erythræus a succession
of books which would have adorned the vernacular
literature if they had belonged to it, appeared in the
common idiom of scholars. Petrarch’s<cite>Canzoniere</cite>, as
respects mere dimension, is as nothing to the mass of
his Latin works. Politian writes just enough Italian to
prove that he might have revived Boccaccio or anticipated
Ariosto. Pontano, one of the brightest intellects
of Italy, writes entirely in Latin. To exclude the Latin
books of such men entirely from consideration is impossible;
but they cannot be adequately treated in a
professed history of vernacular literature; and much
else of deep significance must be passed over without a
hint of its existence.</p>

<p>Another circumstance places the Italian mind at a
disadvantage when contemplated solely through a literary
medium. Literature in Italy is a less exhaustive manifestation
than elsewhere of the intellect of the nation.
The intellectual glory of England, France, and Germany
depends mainly upon their authors and men of science;
their illustrious artists, the succession of great German
composers since Handel excepted, are for the most part
isolated phenomena. In the ages of Italian development,
whether of the imitative arts or of music, artists far outnumber
authors, and the best energies of the country
are employed in artistic production. Of this super-abundant
vitality mere literary history affords no trace.
Michael Angelo, one of the greatest men the world has
seen, can here claim no more than a paragraph on the
strength of a handful of sonnets. It is indeed remarkable
that out of the nine Italians most brilliantly con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[Pg iii]</span>spicuous
in the very first rank of genius and achievement&mdash;Aquinas,
Dante, Columbus, Leonardo, Michael Angelo,
Raphael, Titian, Galileo, Napoleon&mdash;only one should
have been a man of letters. The reader, therefore, who
may deem the field of Italian literature infertile in comparison
with the opulence of England or France, must
remember that it expresses a smaller proportion of the
country’s benefaction to humanity. Yet Jowett is perfectly
justified in claiming for the Italian a front place
among the literatures of the world, but only on condition
that its great representatives shall be weighed
rather than counted.</p>

<p>The comparative&mdash;though only comparative&mdash;paucity
of authors in Italy is so far favourable to the historian
working on a small scale, that it allows a more expansive
treatment of the greatest men, and at the same time the
inclusion of minor writers not always of high distinction,
but indispensable to the continuity of the narrative.
This is essential in a book which does not profess to be
a string of biographies, but a biography of Italian Literature
herself regarded as a single entity revealed through
a succession of personages, the less gifted among whom
may be true embodiments of her spirit for the time
being. Many remarkable manifestations of the national
intellect are, nevertheless, necessarily excluded. Writers
in dialect are omitted, unless when acknowledged classics
like Meli or Belli. Academies and universities are but
slightly mentioned. Theologians, jurists, and men of
science have been passed over, except in so far as
they may also have been men of letters. There is,
in fact, no figure among them like Luther, who,
though not inspired by the love of letters as such, so
embodied the national spirit and exerted so mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[Pg iv]</span>
an influence upon the language, that he could no
more than Goethe be omitted from a history of German
literature.</p>

<p>Some want of proportion may be charged against the
comparatively restricted space here allotted to Dante.
It is indeed true that if genius prescribed the scale of
treatment, at least a third of the book ought to have
been devoted to him; but this very fact refutes the
censure it seems to support, since, the limits assigned
admitting of no extension, all other authors must have
suffered for the sake of one. In a history, moreover,
rather dealing with Italian literature as a whole than
with writers as individuals, the test is not so much
greatness as influence upon letters, and in this respect
Dante is less significant than Petrarch and Boccaccio.
Preceding the Renaissance, he could not profoundly
affect its leading representatives, or the succeeding generations
whose taste was moulded by it; and although at
all times admired and venerated, it was only at the
appearance of the romantic school and the Revolution
that he became a potent literary force. Another reason
for a more compendious treatment of Dante is that
while in the cases of other Italian writers it is difficult to
remedy defects by reference to any special monograph,
English literature possesses several excellent handbooks
to the Divine Comedy, resort to which would be expedient
in any case.</p>

<p>The books to which the writer has been chiefly indebted
are enumerated in a special bibliography. He is
obliged to Mr. W. M. Rossetti and to Messrs. Ellis and
Elvey for permission to use the exquisite translations
from the<cite>Dante and his Circle</cite> of Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, cited in the early chapters of the book. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[Pg v]</span>
graceful versions from Boiardo and other poets contributed
by Miss Ellen Clerke have not, with one exception,
been previously printed. Where no acknowledgment
of indebtedness is made, translations are by the author
of the volume.</p>

<p class="center p4 big2"><small>A HISTORY OF</small><br />
ITALIAN LITERATURE</p>
</div>



<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER I<br />
<small>THE BEGINNINGS OF ITALIAN LITERATURE</small></h2>


<p>Great literatures, like great rivers, seldom derive their
origin from a single fountain, but rather ooze from the
soil in a multitude of almost imperceptible springs. The
literature of Greece may appear an exception, but we
know that the broad stream of Homeric song in which
we first behold it must have been fed by a number of
rills which it has absorbed into itself, and whose original
sources lie beyond the range of scrutiny. In no literature
is this general maxim better exemplified than the
Italian, if, at least, as the economy of this little history
demands, we restrict this appellation to its modern
period. It might be plausibly contended that the Latin
and Italian literatures, like the Roman and Byzantine
empires, are, in truth, a single entity, but the convenience
of the student precludes a view in support of which
much might be adduced by the critic and philologist.
Defining Italian literature, therefore, so as to comprise
whatsoever is written in any dialect of that “soft bastard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
Latin” which bears the Italian name, and to exclude all
compositions in a language which a Roman would have
called Latin, we find none among great literatures whose
beginnings are more humble and obscure, or, which at
first seems surprising, more recent. The perfection of
form which the literature of Italy had attained while all
others, save the Provençal, were yet devoid of symmetry
and polish, the comparative intelligibility of the diction
of “Dante and his circle” at the present day, while the
contemporary writers in other tongues require copious
glossaries, lead to the tacit and involuntary assumption
of a long antecedent period of development and refinement
which did not in fact exist. In truth, the earliest
literary compositions definable as Italian are scarcely
older than the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no other such example in history
of the obliteration of literary taste and method as that
which in Italy befell one of the most gifted peoples of
the world for nearly six hundred years. After Boethius
(about 530 <small>A.D.</small>) the little that is left of literature becomes
entirely utilitarian, and is, with rare exceptions, restricted
to theology, jurisprudence, and monkish chronicles.
There is still much evidence that the Latin classical
writers had not passed out of the knowledge of men;
but&mdash;except when like Virgil they became heroes of
popular legend&mdash;little that they exercised any appreciable
influence upon men’s ideas and imaginations.
One unfortunate precursor of the Renaissance, indeed,
Vilgardus of Ravenna (about <small>A.D.</small> 1000), was led by
his admiration for the classics to disparage Christianity,
and suffered death in consequence. As a rule, however,
the Latin poets merely served as a magazine
of commonplace quotations and an arsenal of metri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>cal
rules, which some of the least degenerate writers
of the period apply with considerable skill. The
explanation of this paralysis of Latin literature in
Italy, while Greek was still an efficient organ of
thought in the Eastern Empire, is no doubt to be found
in the fact that it had never been a robust national
growth. The property of the learned and cultivated, it
had taken no deep hold upon the mass of the people;
and when culture and learning perished amid the vicissitudes
of barbarian conquest, it was only preserved, apart
from the services of the Church, by the absolute necessity
of maintaining some vestiges of law, physic, and
divinity, and the impossibility of conveying instruction
in the debased dialects into which the old Latin language
was resolving itself.</p>

<p>It might have been expected, nevertheless, that these
dialects would have become the vehicles of popular
legend and poetry, and that, as anciently in Greece,
a literature would at length have been evolved from
the tales of the story-tellers and the songs of the
minstrels. The very existence of vernacular minstrels
and story-tellers is but matter of inference, the little
which we possess in any sense referable to this department
being in Latin. The instances laboriously accumulated
by Rubieri to prove the existence of popular
poetry throughout the Dark Ages seem to be all in
this language; and centuries pass without any indication
that the ancestors of Dante thought it possible to
write in any other, and scarcely any that they cared
for written composition at all, except as a medium for
instruction in such knowledge as the age possessed, and
the transaction of the ordinary business of life. The
symptoms of vitality became more evident after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
Christian world had turned the corner of its first millennium.
The eleventh century was in Italy an age of
eminent theologians; it also beheld the musical reforms
of Guido of Arezzo; and towards its conclusion poets
of some note arose to chant in Latin hexameters the
triumphs of Genoa and Pisa over the Saracens. Still,
although, as has been well remarked, the enthusiasm for
the Crusades excited by itinerant preachers goes far to
prove that public addresses were delivered in the popular
dialects, there is not a trace of any written Italian language,
or a hint of any such vernacular literature as existed,
if it hardly flourished, among the Germans, the French,
and the Anglo-Saxons. When at length in the twelfth
century Poetry unmistakably presents herself in the
songs of the wandering students (<em>Goliardi</em>), her attire is
still Latin. But it was much that any class of society
should now be making its own songs, and the transition
to a vernacular lyric was not long or difficult,
although, instead of taking birth among the people, it
was fostered into life by the patronage of Courts.</p>

<p>The first of the Latin nations to acquire a cultivated
vernacular literature was the Provençal. Many reasons,
singly insufficient, but cumulatively of great force, may
be adduced for this unquestionable priority. The language,
which may be roughly but accurately described
as a connecting link between French and Italian, as its
Catalan and Valencian congeners form one between
French and Spanish, is better adapted for poetical composition
than French; while, the Latin influence being
less oppressively overwhelming than in the land of the
Romans, it escaped the ban of provinciality which so
long prohibited serious literary composition in the vernacular
speech of Italy. Before the demon of religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
persecution was unchained by the Popes, the country
enjoyed remarkable prosperity and tranquillity; the
harsher features of the feudal system were mitigated by
industry and commerce, while the aristocratical organisation
of society ensured literature that patronage without
which it could hardly have flourished in the absence
of a reading class.</p>

<p>The early poets of Provence were almost without
exception the favourites of princes and noblemen,
whose exploits they celebrated, whose enemies they
satirised, whose own political course they sometimes
inspired, and for whose gratification they vied with each
other in improvised poetical contests (<em>tenzons</em>). Their
strains, though occasionally lighted up by some bright
thought which Petrarch subsequently did not disdain to
appropriate, appear to us in general artificial and constrained.
This is partly owing to the exaggeration of a
virtue, that attention to “strictest laws of rhyme and
rule,” in which, as an English poet truly declares, the
bard finds “not bonds, but wings.” But the cultivation
of form is carried too far when it becomes the end
instead of the means, and the Provençal poets allowed
themselves to be seduced by their language’s unequalled
facilities for rhyming into an idolatry of the elaborate,
which offered great impediments to the simple expression
of feeling. Some of their strophes contain no
fewer than twenty-eight verses, the same set of rhymes
being carried through the whole stanza, and very frequently
through the entire poem. Out of four hundred
pieces in a single manuscript collection Ginguené
found only two in the simple quatrain. It was fortunate
for the Italians that their language, fluent and
supple as it is, is incapable of such feats, and that, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
adopting their lyrical measures from the Provençals, they
could not, had they wished, cramp themselves by the
reproduction of the latter’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</i>.</p>

<p>It is in the last quarter of the twelfth century that we
find Provençal troubadours established at the Courts of
the North Italian princes, writing exactly such poems as
they would have written at home, and apparently just
as well understood and equally popular, a proof that
neither in Provence nor in Italy had the culture of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i> progressed beyond the highest circles. One
or two of them occasionally mingled an Italian strophe
with their Provençal substance, and at a somewhat later
date Bonvesin da Riva and others wrote in a curiously
mixed dialect of French and Italian. There is, however,
no proper Italian literature until, about 1220, we suddenly
find a school of vernacular poetry flourishing at
Palermo under the patronage of Frederick II., Emperor
of Germany, an Italian on his mother’s side, and by his
tastes and sympathies more of an Italian than of a
German prince. The character of its productions is
in general wholly Provençal, but the language is Italian
of the Tuscan type, and it is a highly interesting question
whether this was the case from the first, or whether
the pieces as we possess them are adaptations from the
Sicilian dialect, which appears from contemporary prose
monuments to have existed at the time nearly in its
present form. We cannot attempt to decide the controversy,
which does not affect the position of the pieces
as the earliest undoubted examples of vernacular Italian
literature. Their poetical merit cannot in general be
rated very highly, and they contain hardly anything
which might not have been written in Provence as well
as in Sicily. Frederick himself was one of the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
writers, and his canzone on his Lady in Bondage might
appear to the English reader to possess considerable
merit, but for the suspicion that the great poet who
translated it infused more poetical inspiration than he
found. It would gain considerably in significance if
Rossetti could be proved right in conjecturing that the
immured lady is a symbol of Frederick’s empire in
captivity to the Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Each morn I hear his voice bid them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That watch me, to be faithful spies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lest I go forth and see the skies;</span><br />
Each night to each he saith the same;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in my soul and in mine eyes</span><br />

<p class="p1"><em>Thus grieves she now; but she shall wear<br />

And for a garland in her hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even yet; because I mean to prove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not to speak only, this my love.</span></em></p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Of the few really Sicilian poets whose verses remain,
the most remarkable is Cielo dal Carno, more commonly
known from the misreading of an ill-written text as
<cite>Ciullo d’Alcarno</cite>. The mention of Saladin has till recently
caused his<cite>Dialogue between Lover and Lady</cite> to
be ascribed to the close of the twelfth century, but more
unequivocal indications prove that it cannot have been
written before 1231. It is a piece of rare merit in its
way, exempt from the insipid gallantry of the typical
troubadour or minnesinger, and full of humour at once
robust and sly at the expense of slippery suitors and
complacent damsels. Nothing can be more delightfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
naïve, for instance, than the knight’s unsolicited confession
that he has stolen his Bible:</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Then, on Christ’s book, borne with me still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To read from and to pray</span><br />
(I took it, fairest, in a church,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The priest being gone away).</span></em></p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the nearly contemporary Tuscan poets may
have belonged to Frederick’s circle, but it will be convenient
to treat of them in the next chapter among
the precursors of Dante. Of the undoubted Sicilian
poets the most remarkable is Jacopo, the notary of
Lentino, depreciated by Dante on account of the rusticity
of his style, a defect which disappears when he
is rendered into another language. Rossetti, speaking
from Lentino’s mask, frequently thrills with strokes of
true magic, as when he names</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em><span style="margin-left: 14em;">the song,</span><br />
Sweet, sweet and long, the song the sirens know.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">In some of Lentino’s sonnets also the germs and
groundwork of Dante’s lyrical poetry are manifestly to
be discovered.</p>

<p>Something should be said here of the lyrical forms
used by the Italian poets of the best ages. The principal
are the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canzone</i>, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sonnet</i>, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ballata</i>. The
canzone admits of several varieties of structure, but
usually commences with three unrhymed lines of eleven
syllables each, followed by three similar lines rhyming to
their predecessors, a seventh of a discretionary number
of syllables rhyming to the third and sixth, and five or
six lines on a different rhyming system, short or long at
the poet’s discretion, yet generally having the last rhyme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
of the preceding system once repeated. The following
stanza from Guido Cavalcanti may serve as an example:</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>But when I looked on death made visible,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From my heart’s sojourn brought before mine eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And holding in her<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> hand my grievous sin,</span><br />
I seemed to see my countenance, that fell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shake like a shadow: my heart uttered cries,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my soul wept the curse that lay therein.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Death: 'Thus much thine urgent prayer shall win:&mdash;</span><br />
I grant thee the brief interval of youth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At natural pity’s strong soliciting.’</span><br />
And I (because I knew that moment’s ruth<br />
But left my life to groan for a frail space)<br />
Fell in the dust upon my weeping face.</em></p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">By this highly intelligent system the vagrant overgrowth
of the Provençal stanza was pruned, and a lyrical
form constituted, which was unsurpassed for the combination
of dignity with melodious grace. The sonnet,
unmatched as the most appropriate form for the harmonious
development of a single thought, is one of
Italy’s most precious gifts to the world of letters. It
is too thoroughly naturalised in this country to need
detailed description; but the caution is not superfluous
that a Shakespearian sonnet, a sonnet on the
French model, or a very irregular sonnet, are strictly
speaking not sonnets, but quatorzains; and that, although
it would be pedantic to insist upon unvarying conformity
to one of the four legitimate Italian structures
of the sestet, they will seldom be widely departed from
without injury to the music and architecture of the
poem. The name <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sonnetto</i>&mdash;a little sound&mdash;(cf. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sonnette</i>)
admirably expresses the pealing effect of a well-mani<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>pulated
sestet. The ballata is less confined by strict
rules. “It is properly a lyric of two or more stanzas,
in the first of which is set out the theme to be amplified
in the following” (Boswell). It often terminates with
an <em>envoy</em> or quasi summing-up, as is frequently the case
with the canzone also. The octave, familiar to English
readers as the metre of<cite>Don Juan</cite>, was generally reserved
for narrative poetry, but was also converted by
the Sicilian poets into a lyrical form by merging the
final couplet in the preceding sestet, as described and
exemplified by an English imitator:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>To thee, fair Isle, Italia’s satellite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Italian harps their native measures lend;</span><br />
Yet, wooing sweet diversity, not quite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy octaves with Italia’s octave blend.</span><br />
Six streaming lines amass the arrowy might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hers, one cataract couplet doth expend.</span><br />
Thine lakewise widens, level in the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like to its beginning is its end.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The <em>sestine</em>, a favourite form with the Provençals, and
frequently used by Dante and Petrarch, is too complicated
to be well understood without an example.</p>

<p>The same phenomenon is observed in Italian literature
as in English&mdash;the decay, after the language had begun
to receive a high scholastic cultivation, of the simple
spontaneous melody which had originally characterised
it. Italian prose probably never possessed the majestic
rhythm and sonorous cadences which came unsought to
English poets of the time of Elizabeth and James; but
Italian verse had its Campions, and these, like ours, left
no successors. Without disparaging the tunefulness of
late writers like Chiabrera, it must still be owned that
this is in a measure artificial, and that the cause is the
divorce of poetry and music. “It seems,” says Panizzi,
“that the art of writing lines in which so much simplicity,
smoothness, and strength were united to so delicate a
proportion of sounds, is lost; and the reason is that in
our days canzoni and sonnets have nothing but the name
of a song.” The most melodious modern poetry, accordingly,
is the portion of Metastasio’s plays which was
actually written to be sung.</p>

<p>It is too early to speak as yet of Italian prose, of which
no important example will be found until we reach
Dante’s<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, near the end of the thirteenth century.
It need only be remarked that the grace of diction
and the intricacy of metrical form which Italian poets
had attained by the middle of the thirteenth century,
show that the language was already capable of fine
prose, and that it was only needful to dispel the superstition
that serious subjects must be treated in a learned
tongue. Poetry prospered in the vernacular for the
obvious reasons that the bards were in general ignorant
of Latin, and that if they had been acquainted with
it their accomplishment would have been wasted upon
the lords and ladies for whom they principally wrote.
The historical or philosophical writer, however, best
reached the classes he addressed through the medium
of Latin. Hence, though for different reasons, we
observe in early Italian literature the same phenomenon
as in early Greek&mdash;a brilliant poetical activity
in the almost total absence of prose composition. Yet,
when Tuscan prose fairly begins, its productions are
the purest examples of diction&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">testi di lingua</i>. This elegance
testifies at once to the innate refinement of the
people and to the continuous operation of intellectual
influences latent in the obscurest deeps of the Dark Ages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER II<br />
<small>THE EARLY ITALIAN LYRIC</small></h2>


<p>It was inevitable that the light thus kindled at the
Sicilian Court should spread to other parts of Italy, those
especially where the vernacular tongue had already
obtained the greatest degree of refinement, and had
developed most aptitude for the purposes of literature.</p>

<p>Dante, examining the dialects of Italy about the beginning
of the fourteenth century, affirms, indeed, that
none of them can be identified as the ideal or pattern
language, which is the common property of educated
Italians everywhere. But he evidently regards Tuscany
and Bologna as greatly in advance of other parts of
Italy; and speaks of the impediments offered by the
local speech of Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio to the
acquisition of pure Italian, in consequence of which, he
says, these cities have produced no poets. Evidently,
therefore, some districts of Italy were more congenial
than others to the Court poetry transplanted from Sicily;
and we find it flourishing exactly where, on Dante’s
principles, this might have been expected, that is, in
Tuscany and the Romagna. About the same time,
Antonio da Tempo, a Paduan, writing on vernacular
poetry, admits that “Lingua Tusca magis apta est ad
literam sive literaturam quam aliæ linguæ, et ideo magis
est communis et intelligibilis.” Almost the same words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
are employed by an anonymous contemporary translator
of the excerpts from the gospels read as lessons
for the day, with the addition that the Tuscan speech is
also the most agreeable. It is no wonder, therefore, that
many of the so-called Sicilian poets should have been
Tuscans, or that Tuscans at home should have been the
first and chief cultivators of Italian poetry, so soon as
this began to be written elsewhere than in Sicily, where
the destruction of the Hohenstaufen dynasty put an end
to it shortly after the middle of the thirteenth century.
The transfer of literary composition from a Court circle
to a republican community was of high importance as a
substitution of freer influences for those by which it had
hitherto been moulded, and we speedily see the new literature
ceasing to be a mere amusement, and becoming in
some measure an organ of thought and opinion. Political
poems, satires, didactic pieces, moral exhortations in
verse become frequent. The literary worth of these,
indeed, is not in general comparable to that of the
amorous strains which had formerly monopolised the
field of poetry, but they show that literature was beginning
to lay hold of the national life, and bear within
them the germs of better things.</p>

<p>The most remarkable representative of the new tendency,
who had previously been a leading representative
of the old, the most influential and the most conspicuous
figure, indeed, among Dante’s forerunners, though far
from the best poet, was G<small>UITTONE DI</small> A<small>REZZO</small>, born
probably about 1235. In his youth Guittone had been
a love poet, after the manner of the troubadours, and
obtained sufficient distinction in the sonnet&mdash;to which,
indeed, he seems to have first given what was to prove
its durable form&mdash;to be afterwards regarded as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
precursor of Petrarch; but towards middle age, under
the influence of religious emotion, he renounced the
world, including his wife and family, and entered the
military, not monastic, order of the Cavalieri di Santa
Maria, known, from the free-and-easy deportment of
some of the brethren, as the Jolly Friars, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Frati
Gaudenti</i>. Guittone, however, seems to have been perfectly
serious in the step he took. He condemned
his former course of life, renounced poetical pursuits,
and dispensed prescriptions against secular lore and
poetry in all their branches. He continued, nevertheless,
to write in verse, and employed the Provençal
metrical forms as of old; but the themes of his muse
are now morality, religion, and, occasionally, politics.
His sentiments entitle him to respect, but his verse is
dreary: Rossetti has been able to find only one piece
of his to repay translation, and this, even in Rossetti’s
hands, does <em>not</em> repay it. He was, nevertheless, much
admired in his own day, and many contemporary
poets were much influenced by him, especially by his
Latinisms; for Guittone was acquainted with such of the
classical writers as were then accessible, and imitated
their constructions with servility and without judgment.
He has a claim to priority as one of the first writers of
Italian prose, on the strength of his epistles. They are
otherwise only remarkable for the Latinised affectation
of their style.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<p>A much more important writer, in a purely literary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>point of view, and the first Italian who can be esteemed
a poet of high merit, is G<small>UIDO</small> G<small>UINICELLI</small> of Bologna
(1220-1276), of whom little is known, except that, like
most men of light and leading in those unquiet times, he
was banished from his native city. His rank in Italian
poetry is prominent, he gave it a more serious and
philosophical character than the troubadours had been
capable of imparting, and his amorous sentiment is
more spirited and impressive. The masterpiece among
Dante’s sonnets&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tanto gentil e tanto onesta pare</i>&mdash;is
undoubtedly adumbrated in one of Guinicelli’s. Dante
calls him “the Sage,” and the canzone of the<cite>Gentle
Heart</cite>, to which the great Florentine is alluding, justifies
his admiration. The following is the first of six
beautiful stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As birds within the green shade of the grove.</span><br />
Before the gentle heart, in Nature’s scheme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love was not, or the gentle heart ere Love.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For with the sun, at once,</span><br />
So sprang the light immediately, nor was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its birth before the sun’s.</span><br />
And Love hath his effect in gentleness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of very self; even as</span><br />
Within the middle fire the heat’s excess.</em></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Much might be said of many other precursors of
Dante, but space admonishes us to restrict ourselves to
two&mdash;Guido delle Colonne, a Sicilian, chiefly known for
his Latin romance on the Fall of Troy, but also a vernacular
lyrist of considerable merit; and Rustico di
Filippo (1200-1274), eulogised by Brunetto Latini as a
man of great worth, but whose place among poets is
mainly that of a satirist. Very biting are his lines on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
certain Messer Ugolino, a member by anticipation of
what Carlyle called “the Heaven and Hell Amalgamation
Society,” “who has good thoughts, no doubt, if
they would stay,” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Would love his party with a dear accord<br />
If only he could once quite care for it.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">One other writer among Dante’s predecessors may be
mentioned, not for his claims as a poet, but as a man so
illustrious that he honoured poetry even by attempting
what he was unqualified to perform. He is no less a
man than St. Francis of Assisi, whose<cite>Song of the
Creatures</cite> is pronounced by Renan “the most perfect
expression given by the modern world of its feeling
for religion.”</p>

<p>Some way past the middle of the century (1265) the
greatest poet of Italy was born, and ere his eyes were
closed Italian literature, in virtue of his works alone, had
taken place among the great literatures of the world.
The distance between Dante and his immediate contemporaries
is much wider than usual in the case of similar
groups of intellectual and gifted men, even if, leaving
Dante’s great poem and his prose works out of sight, we
consider him simply as a lyrist. Yet they do constitute
a group around him, and evince a general development
both in thought and command of language, testifying
to the upheaval which made a Dante possible.
Many might be noticed did space permit, but it will be
necessary to restrict ourselves to two typical instances,
with an additional section on the cultivators of humorous
and satirical poetry, whose writings perhaps afford
surer testimony than those of more ambitious bards that
poetry had actually entered into the life of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
The two men who, but for the existence of Dante, would
have stood forth as the poetical representatives of their
age, are Guido Cavalcanti and Cino da Pistoia. By the
time of their appearance, about 1290, Italian literature
had become for the time entirely concentrated in Tuscany,
and the phenomena which had attended the similar
isolation of Greek literary talent in Attica were destined
to reproduce themselves.</p>

<p>G<small>UIDO</small> C<small>AVALCANTI</small> would be memorable if only for
his youthful friendship with Dante, celebrated in many
poems of both, and more especially in the sonnet, so
well known in England from Shelley’s more poetical than
accurate version, in which Dante wishes for his company,
along with Lapo Gianni and their respective ladies, on
a voyage with him and his Beatrice. Vanna, Cavalcanti’s
lady-love in those days, is mentioned in another sonnet
as the chosen companion of Beatrice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Each</span><br />
Beside the other seemed a thing divine.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Cavalcanti had the reputation of a free-thinker, and
the charge seems hardly refuted by his having made a
pilgrimage to Compostella, even if he ever arrived there,
which may be questioned. It is supposed to have been
on this journey that he made the acquaintance of the
pretty Mandetta of Toulouse, the theme of much of his
verse. He was a leading personage in the Florentine
republic, and his strifes with inimical factions eventually
led to his exile to Sarzana, where he contracted a disease
which carried him off after his return to his native city.</p>

<p>Guido’s merits as a poet were highly estimated by his
contemporaries. Dante mentions him in his treatise
<cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite> among the masters of Italian litera<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>ture,
and declares that he has eclipsed Guido Guinicelli,
whom also he greatly admired. Benevento da Imola,
the commentator on the<cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, names him
along with Dante as one of the two great lights of the
age. That these praises were not undeserved will appear
from a comparison of his lyrics with Dante’s, remembering
that he was the older man and that the obligation was
entirely on the side of the younger. Dante, especially in
his sonnets, is continually borrowing thoughts which,
whether original with Cavalcanti or not, had been previously
expressed by him. The expression is indeed
greatly improved, but even Cavalcanti’s comparatively
rude form is full of charm. In his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ballate</i> he has the
great merit of having exalted a popular carol to the
dignity of literature with little injury to its simplicity. Of
the canzoni ascribed to him only two are recognised as
undoubtedly genuine. Both are instinct with the philosophical
spirit which he imported into poetry. The
objections to the genuineness of the others derived from
external evidence do not always appear very conclusive;
but it must be admitted that there is an almost entire
lack of external testimony in their favour. Four of
them, from one of which we have already borrowed a
quotation, have been translated by Rossetti. The most
celebrated of Guido’s genuine compositions, the canzone
beginning “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Donna mi prega; perch’ io voglio dire</i>,” was
considered by his contemporaries the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of
poetry, but rather for its erudition than its strictly poetical
merits: it had eight separate commentaries, which indeed
were by no means superfluous.</p>

<p>Guittoncino de’ Sinibuldi, commonly called C<small>INO DA</small>
P<small>ISTOIA</small>, a poet of somewhat later date (1270-1336), possessed
less originality than Guido Cavalcanti, but having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
a better standard of taste, is perhaps more generally
pleasing. Like Cavalcanti, he was a man of varied
accomplishments, and it is his special renown to have
been among the first jurists of his time. Like Dante, he
was exiled from his native city, and went to Paris; he
subsequently professed law in several of the chief cities
of Italy, and was eventually restored to his own. His
verse, like Cavalcanti’s, bears a strong affinity to Dante’s
lyrical poetry, and, in the opinion of so accomplished a
judge as Lorenzo de’ Medici, is even more completely
divested of primitive rudeness. His most celebrated
composition is the canzone consoling Dante for the loss
of Beatrice, from which we quote a stanza in Rossetti’s
version:</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Why now do pangs of torment clutch thy heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which with thy love should make thee overjoyed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As him whose intellect has passed the skies?</span><br />
Behold, the spirits of thy life depart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daily to Heaven with her, they so are buoyed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With thy desire, and Love so bids them rise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O God! and thou, a man whom God made wise,</span><br />
To nurse a charge of care, and love the same!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I tell thee in His name</span><br />
From sin of sighing grief to hold thy breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor let thy heart to death,</span><br />
Nor harbour death’s resemblance in thine eyes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God hath her with Himself eternally,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet she inhabits every hour with thee.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Here, and in the remainder of the poem, there is a
clear prefiguration of Petrarch, who admired Cino, and
wrote a sonnet on his death. The following is a favourable
example of Cino’s own sonnets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Descend, fair Pity, veiled in mortal weed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in thy guise my messengers be dight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Partakers to appear of virtuous might</span><br />
That Heaven hath for thy attribute decreed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span><br />
Yet thou, ere on their errand these proceed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Love consent, I pray, recall and cite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My spirits all astray dispersed in flight,</span><br />
That so my songs be bold to sue and plead.<br />
Then, hast thou sight of ladies’ loveliness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thither accede, for I would have thee there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And audience with humility entreat;</span><br />
And charge my envoys, kneeling at their feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their Lord and his desirings to declare:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hear them, sweet Ladies, for their humbleness.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Several other good poets, such as Lapo Gianni, Dino
Frescobaldi, and Gianni Alfani, would deserve notice in
a more elaborate history. They all wrought in the
spirit of Cavalcanti and Dante himself, spiritualising the
earthly passion of the troubadours, and endowing the
ladies of their songs with such superhuman perfections
as to incur the risk of appearing mere types of ideal
virtue. We must, however, pass to a different order of
poetry, the gay and satirical. Here Folgore di San Geminiano
is the leading figure. His political sonnets are very
forcible; but he is better known for two sets of sonnets
on the pleasures of the months and the days of the week,
celebrating, not without an undercurrent of satire, the
luxurious extravagance of a set of wild young men at
Siena, who, another poet informs us, reduced themselves
to beggary thereby. Another humorous poet, justly
defined by Rossetti as the scamp of the Dante circle, is
Cecco Angioleri, who is irreverent enough to call Dante
himself a pinchbeck florin, and whose favourite theme
is his quarrels with his parents:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>My mother don’t do much because she can’t,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I may count it just as good as done,</span><br />
Knowing the way and not the will’s her want.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day I tried a kiss with her&mdash;just one&mdash;</span><br />
To see if I could make her sulks avaunt;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She said, 'The devil rip you up, my son!'</span></em></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Another class of poetry, forming a connecting link
with prose, should be briefly mentioned, the didactic.
The<cite>Tesoretto</cite> of B<small>RUNETTO</small> L<small>ATINI</small> (1210-1294), celebrated
as an encyclopædist of the knowledge of his time, and
still more so as the preceptor or rather Mentor of Dante,
describes a vision in which the poet supposes the secrets
of nature to be revealed to him, and is interesting as in
some measure prefiguring the machinery of the<cite>Divina
Commedia</cite>. Francesco Barberino, a notary, wrote both
in prose and verse on the bringing-up of girls, and
although he is an indifferent writer his work is valuable
as a picture of manners. He seriously discusses the
question whether girls should be taught to read, and
decides it in the negative. An anonymous poem entitled
<cite>La Intelligenzia</cite>, treating philosophically of the emanation
of Divine Wisdom, a conception resembling that of the
Logos, attains a higher grade of poetical merit, but the
best passages appear to be translated from the French
and Provençal. The religious lyric of St. Francis of Assisi
and of the Umbrian school, more interesting in a psychological
than in a literary point of view, culminated about
the end of the thirteenth century in the lays of Jacopino
di Todi, remarkable examples of impassioned mysticism,
and sometimes of satiric force. He is particularly interesting
as a popular poet who owes nothing to culture,
but derives all his inspiration from the ecstatic devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>which in his day animated a large portion of the Italian
common people. The same spirit inspired the<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite>
of a rather later period, which will be more
appropriately considered along with the Italian drama.</p>

<p>Dante’s prose works demand separate treatment; of
earlier examples of prose there is very little to be said.
Historians and theologians continued to compose in
Latin, and the few writings in the vernacular were
chiefly translations from that language. The principal
contemporary book in Italian, the<cite>Tesoro</cite> or great encyclopædia
of Brunetto Latini, is an important monument
of culture, but not of literature. It was, moreover,
originally composed in French.</p>

<p>Italian literature had sprung up from nothingness and
made enormous progress during three-quarters of a
century without having produced a pout of the first or
even of the second rank. There was no want of singers;
rather there seemed reason for apprehension lest, as
Tansillo declared with truth in the Cinque Cento,</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>The Muses’ troop an army had become,<br />
And every hillock a Parnassus grown</em>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">a complaint anticipated by the anonymous writer of a
clever <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ballata</i> in the thirteenth century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>A little wild bird sometimes at my ear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sings his own verses very clear:</span><br />
Others sing louder what I do not hear.<br />
For singing loudly is not singing well;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But ever by the song that’s soft and low</span><br />
The master-singer’s voice is plain to tell.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Few have it, and yet all are masters now,</span><br />
And each of them can trill out what he calls<br />
His ballads, canzonets, and madrigals.<br />
The world with masters is so covered o’er,<br />
There is no room for pupils any more.</em></p>
<p class="right" style="padding-right: 0.5em; ">&mdash;R<small>OSSETTI</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">But the great poet was about to arise who may almost
be said to have created two literatures&mdash;his country’s
and that specially devoted to himself&mdash;and whose own
works are such, that if every other production of Italian
literature were to perish, it would, on their account
alone, continue to deserve a place among the great literatures
of the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER III<br />
<small>DANTE’S LIFE AND MINOR WRITINGS</small></h2>


<p>Creditable as were their essays in the new literary
instrument of thought, Dante’s predecessors can be
regarded as his forerunners only in so far as they had
helped to create an intellectual atmosphere congenial
to the special bent of his genius. The general character
of this may be defined as an alliance of the chivalrous
and impassioned sentiment which had come down from
the troubadours with the science of Aristotle and the
thought of Aquinas. Guido Cavalcanti had shown how
these might be combined, and Dante followed in his
steps without, perhaps, any clear consciousness of his
own infinite superiority; of which, however, a well-known
passage in the<cite>Inferno</cite> seems to intimate that he
eventually came to entertain a sufficient notion.</p>

<p>D<small>ANTE</small> (D<small>URANTE</small>) A<small>LIGHIERI</small> was born at Florence in
1265, in the later part of May. The origin of his family
is variously attributed to Rome, Ferrara, Parma, and
Verona. The first of his ancestors whom he mentions,
Cacciaguida degli Elisei, a crusader in 1147, had bestowed
his wife’s surname of Alighieri upon his son,
and it had continued in the family. Dante’s relatives
belonged to the Guelf party, and had had their share
in the turmoils which for half a century had distracted
Florence no less than most other Italian cities. Of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
boyhood we know nothing, except that he lost his mother
at an early age, and that he profited by the instructions
of the most learned of the Florentines, Brunetto Latini.
He appears to have taken part in several military expeditions
in his youth, and the glimpses of his personal
circumstances which he allows us in the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>
exhibit him as a man of means, mingling on equal terms
with the wealthy and polished society of prosperous
Florence.</p>

<p>If our knowledge of Dante’s outer life at this period
of his history is imperfect, it is otherwise with his
spiritual life, which he has revealed as no other could,
in the above-mentioned<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, written probably
about 1292. This alone would have immortalised him
as the author of the earliest modern book of its class&mdash;though
it had a prototype in the<cite>Confessions of Saint
Augustine</cite>&mdash;and of the first book of genius, or indeed of
any real importance, written in Italian prose. Nothing
can more forcibly proclaim the superiority of Dante’s
mind than the uniqueness of his first production, unless
it be the fact that, high as is its place in literature, its
chief interest for us is its concern with the man. It is
simply the record of his attachment to a young lady
whom he calls Beatrice, and whom Boccaccio enables
us to identify with one whom we know from other
sources to have actually existed, Beatrice de’ Portinari.
The notion that Beatrice is but an abstraction is utterly
refuted, to adduce no other testimony, by Cino’s consolatory
poem on her death, quoted in the preceding
chapter, and can only be entertained by those who know
little of love, or are entirely possessed by the passion for
allegorising. If ever intense affection was conveyed in
intense language it is here, while at the same time the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
passion is purely Platonic, and there is no proof that it
was in any degree shared by its object, who appears to
have been already married.</p>

<p>Dante’s biographers, except the late and untrustworthy
Filelfo, cast no doubt on the real existence of Beatrice,
and it would require very strong evidence to overthrow
the testimony of the chief among them, Boccaccio, who
lived near Dante’s age, whose veneration for him was
boundless, and who was personally acquainted with his
daughter. We can perceive no adequate reason for
the scepticism of Scartazzini and others respecting
Boccaccio’s trustworthiness. It is true that the use
which he made of his opportunities falls sadly below
the modern standard. Not only is he careless in collecting
and verifying authorities, but he makes no
attempt to think himself back into the period of his
hero. “Between him and the enthusiasms of the Middle
Ages,” says Symonds, “a ninefold Styx already rolled
its waves.” Yet his faults are offences of defect, not of
excess in statement, though he sins by introducing many
useless disquisitions. His work exists in two shapes, a
longer and a shorter recension. The latter is undoubtedly
an unauthorised abridgment of the former,
and the novel statements which it occasionally introduces
can claim no authority from Boccaccio. It seems
to have been made by some Florentine who was offended
by the severity of Boccaccio’s strictures upon his city for
her ingratitude to Dante.</p>

<p>The biography by Filippo Villani, one of his<cite>Lives of
Illustrious Florentines</cite>, written about 1400, is mainly taken
from Boccaccio, but is important for its vindication of
Dante from the charge of profligacy, and for its particular
details of his last illness. The valuable life by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
Leonardo Bruni (1369-1414) is avowedly designed as a
supplement to Boccaccio, who in Bruni’s opinion had
neglected weighty matters for love stories and such-like
frivolities. He therefore, while omitting all mention
of Beatrice and the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, gives a much fuller
account than Boccaccio of Dante’s share in the affairs
of Florence, and even cites an autograph letter of his,
now lost like all others. He is entitled to much
respect as a sensible and impartial writer, who took
pains to obtain information; while the later mediæval
biographers, Manetti and Filelfo, have some literary
merit, but no historical value. Of the other three it
may be said that a statement in which any two of them
agree may usually be received, and that the assertion of
any one is entitled to a fair amount of credit when it
is not contradicted by another’s. The absolute trustworthiness
of the chronicle long attributed to Dinoi
Campagni must now be given up; it is, nevertheless,
most probably of sufficient antiquity to have preserved
some authentic notices.</p>

<p>No biographer of Dante, however, could possibly have
compared with Dante himself, and it is much to be
lamented that the entire disappearance of what must
have been for his time an extensive body of correspondence
has deprived us of all autobiographic record
except the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, which, almost devoid of incident,
paints the inner man with lively force. Except Shelley’s
<cite>Epipsychidion</cite>, the world has nothing to set beside this
dithyrambic of purely Platonic passion. We must recur
to it, and need only here fix the death of Beatrice, one
of the great landmarks of Dante’s life, at June 9, 1290.
Somewhat more than a year afterwards we find Dante
moved, as a noble soul might well be, not by the attrac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>tions
but by the spiritual sympathy of a compassionate
lady. It is impossible to entertain the least doubt of the
reality of an episode described by himself with such
tenderness of self-excuse and poignancy of self-reproach,
but to admit it is to admit the actuality of all the rest of
the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>The salt stream that did sorrowfully flow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speeded, ye Eyes, from your deep springs apace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave marvel unto all who such long space</span><br />
Beheld you weeping, as yourselves do know.<br />
Now fear I that all such ye would forgo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I upon my own part would be base,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not all shift and subterfuge displace,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon me, sore disquieted with dread</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of her who looks on you in wistful wise.</span><br />
By nothing less than Death should you be wrought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E’er to forget your Lady who is dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus saith my heart, and afterward it sighs.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Dante appears to say that he entirely overcame this
rather regrettable than reprehensible lapse from his ideal,
and we believe him. If so, the pitiful lady cannot be
identified with Gemma Donati, whom, at latest in 1293,
if she had really borne him seven children by 1300, he
married by the persuasion of his friends. The<cite>Vita
Nuova</cite> was in all probability written by this time, and
from its conclusion we learn that Dante was even then
preparing to celebrate Beatrice in the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>.
It is therefore exceedingly improbable that he would
have wedded one at all likely to impair or efface the
freshness of her image in his soul; and though his union
with Gemma was apparently untroubled by discord, it
probably lacked all consecration but the ceremonial. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
was brought to a close by Dante’s exile from his native
city in 1301. Gemma and the children did not accompany
him, and he never saw them more. The reason is
not difficult to discover: it prefigured the case of Milton.
Gemma’s family, the Donati, had come to belong to a
party opposed to Dante. The interests of her numerous
children, mostly of very tender age, undoubtedly counselled
Gemma to cleave to the winning side, and she can
scarcely be blamed if she declined to forsake her blood
relations for a husband whom she had probably found
unsympathetic. Whether Dante approved her course, or
rejoiced in his liberty (Short-sighted Devil, not to take
his spouse!), or was simply choked by indignation, he
never honours or dishonours her by a single word.
Gemma Donati’s portrait hangs in the gallery of poets’
wives, like Marshal Marmont’s in the gallery of French
marshals, covered by a veil of crape.</p>

<p>Few of the more distinguished Italian men of letters
have been able to keep themselves clear of public employment.
Dante’s wealth and social eminence in the
days of his prosperity did not allow him to decline the
invidious office of Prior, to which he was raised in 1300.
It was only tenable for two months, but this was long
enough for his ruin. Florence was then rent by dissensions
between two factions, the Whites and Blacks.
The Government, by Dante’s courageous and probably
wise advice, resolved to banish the leaders of both. As
the chiefs of the Guelfic Blacks were Dante’s own connections,
the Donati, while the Ghibelline Whites included
Guido Cavalcanti, his most intimate friend, his
counsel must have been patriotic and disinterested.
Unfortunately, it was not unflinchingly carried out,
some of the Whites being shortly afterwards allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
to return. Pope Boniface VIII., fearing that the Ghibelline
or Imperialist party would thus obtain the upper
hand in the city, incited Charles de Valois, brother of
the French King, Philip the Fair, whom he had allured
into Italy to attack the King of Naples, to make himself
master of Florence. This he accomplished, and the consequent
return of Dante’s adversaries led to the sacking
of his house, the ruin of his fortune, and his life-long
exile from his native city. He was at the time absent
on an embassy at the Papal Court, from which he retired
to Arezzo, where the other exiles had assembled, and
must henceforth be reckoned among the Ghibellines.</p>

<p>For some years Dante participated in their endeavours
to reinstate themselves by force; but eventually, well-nigh
as disgusted with his friends as with his enemies,
scorning the ignominious terms on which alone return
would have been permitted, and especially discouraged
by the failure of the Emperor Henry VII., whose advent
to Italy he had welcomed with enthusiasm, he became
a wanderer among the courts of the princes and nobles
of Northern Italy, generally finding honour and protection,
which he frequently repaid by diplomatic services.
There seems no doubt of his having visited Paris and
studied in the University. The alleged extension of his
journey to Oxford is unsupported by convincing evidence,
but is not impossible or improbable. A writer
near his own day seems to assert that he had been in
England. During all this time, like his ancient prototype
Thucydides, he was devoting himself to his immortal
work, which, published as the respective parts were completed,
brought him celebrity and wondering reverence
even in his lifetime. His most distinguished patron in
his later years was Cane della Scala, surnamed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
Great, Lord of Verona, from whose court he retired in
1320 to that of Guido Novello da Polenta, at Ravenna.
In the following year he undertook a mission to Venice,
and there contracted a fever, which, aggravated it is said
by the inhospitality of the Venetians in compelling him
to return by land, carried him off on September 14,
1321, shortly after he had completed his great epic. His
funeral obsequies were celebrated with magnificence;
but political troubles delayed for a hundred and sixty
years the erection of the monument ultimately raised
by the piety of Cardinal Bembo’s father, then governing
Ravenna for the Venetians, and inscribed with six
rhyming Latin verses attributed without adequate evidence
to Dante’s own pen, but sufficiently ancient to
have been expanded by Boccaccio into a noble sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Dante am I, of deepest lore in song<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Wisdom reigns, and Envy hath not place.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">It is usual to commence a review of an author’s productions
by his most important work; but the<cite>Divina
Commedia</cite> requires a chapter to itself, and precedence
must consequently be given to Dante’s minor writings.
Of these the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite> stands first both in time and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
in importance. It is epoch-making in many ways, as
the first great example of Italian prose, the first revelation
of the genius of the greatest mediæval poet, and
the incarnation of that romantic conception of ideal
love by which the Middle Age might fairly claim to have
augmented the heritage bequeathed by antiquity. The
main note of Dante’s genius here is its exquisite and
unearthly spirituality, which, indeed, is visible in much
of the poetry and art of the time, but attains its most
intense expression in him. Something like it has occasionally
been seen since, as in John Henry Newman;
but it is in our day too much out of keeping with
the legitimate demands of a busy and complicated
society to occur except as a temporary and individual
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable in a composition apparently
so fanciful than the entire sincerity and straightforwardness
of the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>: grant that Beatrice
was a real person, and it is impossible to doubt the
literal truth of the entire narrative. This is the more
extraordinary in consideration of the impersonality alike
of the enamoured poet and of the object of his passion.
Dante, indeed, speaking throughout in his own character,
cannot help portraying himself in some measure,
though our conception of him is probably largely made
up of involuntary associations with the more palpable
Dante of the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>. But Beatrice remains
what he meant her to be, a spiritual presence, visible but
intangible. No heroine of fiction conveys a stronger
impression of perfection; but we see her as Andromeda
saw Medusa, merely reflected in the mind of
her lover.</p>

<p>More extraordinary works than the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite> have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
been composed at even an earlier age, but there is
perhaps no other book in the world in which a young
man appears as asserting by his first attempt so unchallenged
a superiority over predecessors and contemporaries,
with whom he has nevertheless much in
common. The evolution of Italian poetry has up to
this point proceeded gradually and systematically; all
of a sudden it makes a bound, and seems as it were to
have sprung across a chasm. The prose is of more
equable desert than the interspersed poetry, some of
which is inferior; while, on the other hand, the best
poetry far transcends the prose. The finest among the
sonnets and canzoni, if sometimes rivalled, have not
hitherto been surpassed in Italian literature, while the
most famous of the former still stands at the head of
its own class:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>So goodly and so seemly doth appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Lady, when she doth a greeting bring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That tongue is stayed, silent and quivering,</span><br />
And eye adventures not to look on her.<br />
She thence departeth, of her laud aware,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meek in humility’s apparelling;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And men esteem her as a heavenly thing</span><br />
Sent down to earth a marvel to declare.<br />
Whoso regardeth, so delightedly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beholds, his eyes into his heart instil</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet only to be known by tasting it;</span><br />
And from her face invisibly doth flit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A gentle spirit Love doth wholly fill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That to the soul is ever saying, Sigh.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The length of Italian canzoni renders it extremely
difficult to do them justice in a work of necessarily
contracted limits. Two stanzas, however, of Dante’s
canzone on the death of his lady are, as it were, a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
poem complete in themselves, and may be cited in
Rossetti’s matchless version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>I was a-thinking how life fails with us<br />
Suddenly after such a little while;<br />
When Love sobbed in my heart, which is his home.<br />
Whereby my spirit waxed so dolorous<br />
That in myself I said, with sick recoil:<br />
'Yea, to my Lady too this Death must come.’<br />
And therewithal such a bewilderment<br />
Possessed me, that I shut mine eyes for peace;<br />
And in my brain did cease<br />
Order of thought, and every healthful thing.<br />
Afterwards, wandering<br />
Amid a swarm of doubts that came and went,<br />
Some certain women’s faces hurried by,<br />
And shrieked to me, 'Thou too shalt die, shalt die!'</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>Then saw I many broken, hinted sights<br />
In the uncertain state I stepped into.<br />
Meseemed to be I know not in what place,<br />
Where ladies through the streets, like mournful lights,<br />
Ran with loose hair, and eyes that frightened you<br />
By their own terror, and a pale amaze:<br />
The while, little by little, as I thought,<br />
The sun ceased, and the stars began to gather,<br />
And each wept at the other;<br />
And birds dropped in mid flight out of the sky,<br />
And earth shook suddenly,<br />
And I was 'ware of one, hoarse and tired out,<br />
Who asked of me, 'Hast thou not heard it said?<br />
Thy lady, she that was so fair, is dead’.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Although the <em>Vita Nuova</em> is essentially true history, the
same cannot be said of a later work preferred to it by
the author himself, albeit posterity has reversed his
judgment. This is the<cite>Convito</cite>, or<cite>Banquet</cite>, in which
Beatrice appears as an allegory of divine philosophy.
The process of this mutation is not difficult to discover.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
Not long after her death, Dante, as he tells us at the
end of the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, had resolved, under the influence
of a wondrous vision, “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">di dire di lei quello che mai non
fu detto d’alcuna</i>.” The mortal maiden thus necessarily
becomes a type of supernatural glory and perfection, as
we see her in the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>, and the metamorphosis
inevitably extends to the lyrics in which
Dante celebrates her. She is no longer Beatrice de’
Portinari, but Philosophy, and unfortunately in too many
instances Dante’s poetry has become philosophy also.
The nobility of the form still assures it pre-eminence over
all contemporary verse but the author’s own; but the
substance is often mere reasoning in rhyme. Two canzoni,
however, are of distinguished beauty, “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Voi ch’ intendendo
il terzo ciel movete</i>” (translated by Shelley), and
“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tre donne intorno al cor mi son venute</i>,” which Coleridge
says, in 1819, he is at length beginning to understand
after reading it over twelve times annually for the last
fourteen years. “Such a fascination had it in spite of
its obscurity!”</p>

<p>The former of these pieces is shown by internal evidence
to have been written as early as 1295, and the latter
was composed after Dante’s banishment, to which period
most of the other canzoni and the prose commentary
probably belong. This commentary constitutes the substance
of the work. It was intended to have expounded
fourteen canzoni, but treats only of three, apart from
a general introduction. More remarkable, perhaps, than
the philosophical subtleties of which it consists, is Dante’s
appeal to a new public. He writes no longer for literary
circles, but for the world of persons of worth wherever
found, especially persons of rank. Hence the treatise
is necessarily composed in Italian, which has the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
effect of drawing from Dante a spirited vindication of
his native tongue. It was probably completed up to
the point where the author left it by 1308 or 1309.
The exceedingly corrupt text has been revised by the
last editor, Dr. Moore, upon the authority of two
manuscripts in England.</p>

<p>The literary merits of the Italian language are more
fully expounded in another work of Dante’s, which,
however, he composed in Latin, that his arguments
might reach those who would not have condescended to
read the vernacular. The<cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite>, originally
entitled<cite>De Eloquentia Vulgari</cite>, or<cite>Of the Vulgar Tongue</cite>,
is shown by historical allusions to have been composed
by 1304. Like the<cite>Convito</cite> it is unfinished, only two
books of the four of which it was to have consisted
having been written. Dante’s conception of the capabilities
of his native tongue does him honour, even
though he restricts the number of subjects adapted to
it, and would deny its use to all but gifted writers. It
is a still higher honour to have recommended it more
effectually by his example than by his reasonings, which,
as was inevitable in his age, frequently rest upon entirely
fanciful and visionary data. His account, nevertheless,
of the Italian dialects as they existed in his day, and his
precepts on the metrical structure of Italian poetry,
which he seems not to have then contemplated as
capable of existing apart from music, retain a substantial
value for all time.</p>

<p>The hopes founded upon the appearance of the
Emperor in Italy in 1311 probably induced Dante to
publish a work written some years previously, his
treatise<cite>De Monarchia</cite>, embodying the best mediæval
conception of the spheres of temporal and spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
government upon earth. So powerfully had the universality
of Roman sway impressed men’s minds, that
the Roman people were believed to have obtained the
empire of the earth by the donation of Heaven, and
the Emperor of Germany was regarded as their lawful
representative. This belief, so strange to us, was, nevertheless,
salutary in its time, by repressing the champions
of universal despotism who made the Pope
the fountain of secular as well as spiritual authority.
By numerous arguments satisfactory to himself, but
which would now be considered entirely irrelevant,
Dante proves that universal monarchy is a portion of
the Providential scheme, that the Romans possessed
by divine appointment jurisdiction over the entire earth.
The inheritance of this prerogative by the Emperor of
Germany is taken for granted, and it is next demonstrated
that the Emperor does not derive his authority
from the Church, any more than the Church hers from
the Emperor. Yet Cæsar is to be reverent to Peter, as
the first-born son to his father. There is no trace of
religious heterodoxy in the treatise, though nothing can
be more uncompromising than its limitation of the Papal
authority to its legitimate sphere.</p>

<p>The amount of fugitive poetry ascribed to Dante is
inconsiderable. Bruni, in his biography, remarks that
there are two classes of poets&mdash;those who sing by inspiration
and those who compose by art&mdash;and that Dante
belongs to the second. It cannot be admitted that
Dante was devoid of inspiration, but it is certainly true
that he was one of those who possess a special power of
regulating this divine gift. A Shelley or a Coleridge
must write when the impulse seizes him; but a Milton,
with the conception of<cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in his mind, can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
defer putting pen to paper for seventeen years, and, with
consummate lyric power, is but unfrequently visited by
the lyric impulse. Dante, so marvellously similar to
Milton in many respects, also, if we may trust his
account of the genesis of the pieces in the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>,
but seldom found himself under an irresistible impulse
to lyrical composition. Something suggests to him that
a sonnet or a canzone would be expedient or decorous;
he plots it out, and fills up the outline with unerring
fidelity to his first conception. The gigantic plan of the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite> is similarly carried out without interruption
or misgiving; and but for the death of Beatrice,
it is by no means certain that it would have existed, any
more than that Milton would have written<cite>Comus</cite> if the
noble children had never been lost in the wood.</p>

<p>A poet of this stamp was not likely to enrich literature
with much fugitive verse. A few occasional poems
glitter here and there, to employ Wordsworth’s simile,
like myrtle leaves in his chaplet of bay. The most
remarkable among them is a sestine, the finest example
of its artificial and elaborate class, and superbly translated
by Rossetti; this and other pieces are supposed
to refer to a certain Pietra, otherwise unknown. These
poems seem to breathe the language of genuine passion,
but are too few and of too uncertain date to contribute
much to the solution of the question whether
Dante was, as Boccaccio asserts, remarkable for susceptibility
to female charms, or a paragon of continence,
as Villani will have him. It is at least certain
that, after Beatrice, no woman exercised any noteworthy
influence upon his writings. He moves through
life a great, lonely figure, estranged from human fellowship
at every point: a citizen of eternity, misplaced and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
ill-starred in time; too great to mingle with his age, or,
by consequence, to be of much practical service to it;
too embittered and austere to manifest in action the
ineffable tenderness which may be clearly read in his
writings; one whose friends and whose thoughts are
in the other world, while he is yet more keenly alive
than any other man to the realities of this; one whose
greatness impressed the world from the first, and whom
it does not yet fully know, after the study of six hundred
years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE DIVINE COMEDY</small></h2>


<p>To have assumed a position so far in advance of, and so
decisively discriminated from, that of any of his contemporaries,
as in the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>, would alone have
ensured Dante immortality as a poet. But his lyrical
works are to his epic as Shakespeare’s sonnets to Shakespeare’s
dramas.</p>

<p>Any narrative in verse not familiar or humorous, nor
of extreme brevity, may be entitled an epic; although we
might do well to naturalise, as we have done in the case
of  <em>idyll</em>, the pretty Greek word <em>epyll</em> to denote a narrative
composition of such compass as Keats’s<cite>Eve of
St. Agnes</cite> or Wordsworth’s<cite>Laodamia</cite>. But there are
at least three classes of epics, excluding the merely
romantic like the<cite>Orlando</cite>, and the mock-heroic, from
consideration. The most important in every point of
view is the national, originally not the work of a man
but of a people; sometimes, as in the<cite>Iliad</cite> and<cite>Odyssey</cite>,
indebted for its final form to the shaping hand of the
most consummate genius; sometimes, as in the Finnish
<cite>Kalevala</cite>, an agglomeration of legends, united by community
of spirit, but not fashioned into an artistic whole.
At the remotest point from these stands the artificial
epic, like the<cite>Teseide</cite> of Boccaccio or the<cite>Jason</cite> of
William Morris, where the poet has selected for its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
mere picturesqueness a subject which stands in no
vital relation to himself and his times; and such epics
are necessarily the most numerous.</p>

<p>Yet there is an intermediate class of epic, partly
national, partly artificial, where the poet, conscious of
a high patriotic purpose, has, like Virgil and Camoens,
sung the glories of his country at their zenith; or, like
Lucan, actually related contemporary history; or, like
Shelley in the<cite>Revolt of Islam</cite>, bodied this forth under
the veil of allegory; or, like Tasso, embalmed ere too
late the feeling of an age passing away. Two great epic
poets of the intermediate class have done more than
this: they have preserved and expressed the sentiment
of their age, its replies to the deepest questions which
man can propound; have clothed these abstractions
with form, colour, and music, and have lent fleeting
opinion an adamantine immortality. These are Dante
and Milton.</p>

<p>“Dante,” says Shelley, “was the second epic poet, that
is, the second poet the series of whose creations bore a
defined and intelligible relation to the knowledge and
sentiment and religion of the age in which he lived.
Milton was the third.” Hence Shelley in another place
calls Milton “the third among the sons of light.” Both
these great men, in truth, versed in all the learning of
their ages, and entertaining a conviction of the indefeasible
truth of what they believed themselves to know
which no successor will be able to share, applied themselves
to embody these beliefs in works of genius. Even
as great empires have vanished from the earth, and left
nothing but the works of art which were not the greatness
itself but merely its testimonies and symbols, so here the
opinions have gone while the works remain. It almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
seems a law that every great poem which thus resumes
the thought of an age shall be a song, not of Carlyle’s
phœnix “soaring aloft, hovering with outstretched wings,
filling earth with her music,” but rather of the same
phœnix “with spheral swan-song immolating herself in
flame, that she may soar the higher and sing the clearer.”
Homer’s theology, we may be sure, was already obsolete
for the higher Greek mind when, or not long after,</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><span style="margin-left: 5em;"> <em>The Iliad and the Odyssee</em></span><br />
<em>Rose to the swelling of the voiceful sea.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Our own national epic, Shakespeare’s series of historical
plays, could not be written until the state of
society it depicted was ceasing to exist.</p>

<p>Dante himself has told us the origin of his poem. In
the last sonnet of his<cite>Vita Nuova</cite> he represents himself
as having in thought followed Beatrice from earth to
heaven:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Beyond the sphere that doth all spheres enfold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passes the sigh that from my heart takes flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By weeping Love with new perception dight</span><br />
Sure way to the ethereal vault to hold;<br />
Then having won unto that height untold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Lady throned in honour hath he sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resplendent so, that by the vesturing light</span><br />
The spirit peregrine doth her behold.<br />
So seen, that when he doth report the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I miss his sense, so subtle doth it seem</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unto the grieving heart that makes demand;</span><br />
Vet know I that my Lady is his theme,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For oft he nameth Beatrice’s name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then, dear Ladies, well I understand.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Here is the germ of the<cite>Paradiso</cite>, at all events; but,
to preclude all misapprehension, Dante adds: “After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
this sonnet there appeared to me a wondrous vision,
wherein I beheld things which made me resolve to
say no more concerning my Blessed One until I could
treat of her more worthily. And that I may attain unto
this I study with all my might, as she truly knoweth.
Wherefore if it shall be the pleasure of Him by whom all
things live that my life shall yet endure for some years, I
hope to say concerning her that which has never been said
concerning any woman.” The<cite>Vita Nuova</cite> is believed
to have been written about 1294. At this time, therefore,
Dante was meditating a poetical apotheosis of Beatrice
on a scale surpassing anything attempted before, although
the natural inference from his words would seem
to be that he had not yet begun to write.</p>

<p>He would probably at first contemplate nothing more
than the expansion of the thought of his sonnet into a
vision somewhat resembling that of Laura in Petrarch’s
<cite>Trionfi</cite>; but ere long he might say to himself, inverting
the question which Ellwood the Quaker addressed to
Milton: “Thou hast told us of Paradise <em>gained</em>, what
hast thou to tell us of Paradise <em>lost</em>?” and, granted the
existence of the intermediate realm of Purgatory, the
entire scheme of the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite> would be present
to his mind. As poets but rarely “imitate the example
of those two prudent insects the bee and the spider,” he
would begin with the<cite>Inferno</cite>, where, notwithstanding
the inscription, offensive to an age as far in advance of
its sentiment as Dante himself was in advance of Homer’s
polytheism and anthropomorphism, which he has thought
fit to place upon the portal, Beatrice could have neither
part nor lot. It must be long indeed before he could
rejoin her.</p>

<p>It can hardly be said, then, that Beatrice is the heroine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
of his poem, unless Helen of Troy is the heroine of the
<cite>Iliad</cite>. Neither poem could have existed without the
woman; the action of each turns entirely upon her; but
the appearance of each is infrequent until, in Beatrice’s
case, she appears as the pervading spirit of the <em>Paradiso</em>.
Yet, had we merely known her from the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>,
their opinion who regard her as a mere symbol
would not have appeared so groundless as it must in the
light of the transparent autobiography of the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>.
If the great epic has given her her world-wide fame, she
is indebted for her personality to the brief lyrics and
snatches of impassioned prose. The old love, though
not extinct, had been transformed into something far more
expansive, as alchemists are said to revive a glowing rose
from the ashes of a faded one. When Dante himself
essays to give Can Grande some insight into the purpose
of his poem, he does not mention Beatrice, but says:
“The object of the whole work is to make those who live
in this life leave their state of misery, and to lead them
to a state of happiness.” By this, as Symonds points
out, is not to be understood that the purpose of the
poem was the admonition of individuals. “It was both
moral and political. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status miseriæ</i> was the discord
of divided Christendom as well as of the unregenerate
will; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status felicitatis</i> was the pacification of the
world under the coequal sway of Emperor and Pope
in Rome, as well as the restoration of the human soul
to faith.”</p>

<p>The conception, therefore, was essentially mediæval.
It expressed the beliefs and aspirations of the Middle
Age. It was in poetry what the work of another of the
greatest of the Italians, St. Thomas Aquinas, had been in
theology and philosophy&mdash;an endeavour to stereotype<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
the dominant convictions of the age. And therefore,
although not among the only genuine epics in the
highest sense&mdash;those which the nations have written
for themselves&mdash;the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite> approaches these
more nearly than any other epic of the second class;
for, although the utterance of a single voice, it says
what the average mediæval man would have said had
he known how. The nearest parallel is Milton’s epic,
which sets forth the view of divine things which had
commended itself to a large portion of the Christian
world, but still only to a portion, and therefore a less
memorable deliverance than Dante’s. One needs only
to consider how much lower the Middle Ages would
stand in our estimation if their great interpreter had
never written, to appreciate the enormous importance
of Dante’s work for history and culture.</p>

<p>Dante’s great position, nevertheless, in this point of
view, somewhat detracts from his originality in other
respects. He is the man of his age, not a man in advance
of his age. He does not, like Goethe, point the
path of progress along an illimitable future. He has no
prevision of Bacon and Galileo; nor is he fertile in
germs, hints, or prefigurements of greater things to
come. His philosophy is that of Aquinas, and his
science that of Aristotle. This in no way impairs his
poetical power, and it still remains the greatest of
marvels that the transcendent poet and the most representative
thinker of the age should have met in the same
person. Much that appears original in him is really not
peculiar to him, as, for instance, his generous treatment
of the heathen world. There was nothing in this that
could surprise any contemporary. The beatification of
the Emperor Trajan was already an approved legend,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
and similar promotions in the instances of Ripheus and
Statius only carry the principle somewhat further. His
astonishing treatment of Ulysses might be regarded as a
strong counterpoise, but it must be remembered that he
was unacquainted with Homer, and probably took his
view of the character of Ulysses from the<cite>Æneid</cite>. On
the whole, his attitude towards the classical world is
highly to his credit; but it merely expresses the dim
perception of his age, that greater men and greater civilisations
had flourished before them, and that inspiration
from these was wanting to transform the semi-barbarism
around them into a well-ordered society. Hence Dante’s
loving devotion to Virgil, the only portrait in his epic
that evinces any considerable power of character painting;
and his tenderness to all things classical. Had he
flourished along with Petrarch and Boccaccio, Dante
would have been a great humanist, his scholarship and
statesmanship would have found wider and more profitable
fields of action than his own age vouchsafed to
them; but we should not have had the<cite>Divine Comedy</cite>,
towering above every other work of the age much
higher even than Shakespeare towers above contemporary
dramatists; and all his own, even to its metrical
structure, since <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i> appears to have been Dante’s
invention.</p>

<p>The thought at the foundation of the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>,
nevertheless, is more ancient than Dante, although
the details evince marvellous fertility of invention. The
idea of a descent to the underworld is the groundwork
of a primitive Assyrian epic in comparison with whose
antiquity the similar narratives in the Buddhistic and
other scriptures are but of yesterday. It is found in
Plato’s<cite>Republic</cite> and the<cite>Odyssey</cite>, both unknown to Dante,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
who had, however, the sixth book of the<cite>Æneid</cite> by heart,
and implies his obligation by making Virgil his guide.
This is a much more likely source for his poem than the
vision of Tundal and other similar mediæval legends,
which are nevertheless important as showing how strong
was the hold of the conception upon the popular mind.
The vast difference between Virgil’s treatment and
Dante’s needs no elucidation. Virgil writes like a philosopher,
and Dante like a prophet. There is, no doubt,
abundance of allegory in the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite>, but,
generally speaking, the poet’s vision is direct and immediate.
Symonds puts the essence of the poem into a
word by calling it apocalyptic, and perhaps there is no
other great work to which on the whole it presents so
close an analogy as the Revelation of St. John; but
neither this nor any forerunner affords any precedent
for Dante’s astonishing innovation of peopling the
unseen worlds mainly with his own and his readers’
contemporaries, men whose hands he had clasped or
repelled, with whom he had sat at the council-board
or whom he had encountered in conflict, or who,
personally unknown, had thrilled him with the report
of their fortunes or misfortunes, their good deeds or
their crimes.</p>

<p>Let any one try to imagine a modern poet treating the
nineteenth century in the same manner, and he will be
penetrated by a sense of the gigantic nature of the attempt,
success in which could only be possible to an intense
realist capable of making his phantoms as substantial as
when they walked the earth. Yet this is only one side
of Dante’s mighty task, which was not only to render the
unseen world visible and almost palpable, but to embody
what he fondly believed to be a system of infallible dog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>matic
truth. It need hardly be said that it is to the
consummate execution of the former part of his mission
that he is chiefly indebted for his fame with the world at
large. The<cite>Inferno</cite>, where description and portraiture
predominate, has impressed the imagination of mankind
far more powerfully than the more mystical and doctrinal
<em>Purgatorio</em> and <em>Paradiso</em>.</p>

<p>This is not the judgment of the most refined readers.
“The acutest critics,” says Shelley, “have justly reversed
the judgment of the vulgar, and the order of
the great acts of the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite> is the measure
of the admiration which they accord to Hell, Purgatory,
and Paradise.” “The whole <em>Purgatorio</em>,” says
Symonds, “is a monument to the beauty and tranquillity
of Dante’s soul. The whole <em>Paradiso</em> is a proof of its
purity and radiance and celestial love.” This is true,
and yet it is indisputable that in thinking of Dante the
<em>Inferno</em> always comes first to the mind, and that this
portion of his poem, had one part only been published,
would have done far more to preserve his name
than either of the others in the like case, and this
although it is far more tainted than they are with his
most characteristic and least pardonable faults. The
chief causes, no doubt, are that the material sublime is
always more impressive to the mass of men than the
moral; that there is an element of risk and adventure in
the poet’s journey among the shades absent from the
other two parts; and that Virgil is a more tangible and
human personage than Beatrice. Yet it must also be
admitted that the diviner beauty of the two latter parts
suffers from an admixture of theological and philosophical
disquisition, not the less tedious because it was
impossible for the poet to avoid it. Milton tells us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
that the fallen spirits reasoned “of fate, freewill, fore-knowledge
absolute,” but judiciously avoids reporting
their observations.</p>

<p>Dante’s place in comparison with the other chief poets
of the world is difficult to determine, for none but he
has written an apocalypse. He is emphatically the Seer
among them, the “Soothsayer” in the original sense of
the term, the most independent of poetical fiction and
convention. He is also by far the most individual and
autobiographic, and the only one who is the hero of his
own poem. Milton, who is most naturally paralleled
with him, does not deliver a revelation, but records a
history. This at once places Dante in a higher category
than Milton as an elementary force, and when we consider
the circumstances of their respective ages it seems
impossible to deny that Dante was by far the more
wonderful man. This does not necessarily establish the
superiority of the<cite>Divina Commedia</cite> to<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.
Isaiah presents himself in a more august and venerable
character than Homer, but his prophecy is not as
majestic as the<cite>Iliad</cite>. It is also difficult, when assigning
the relative ranks of poets, to discriminate strictly between
the claims that arise from mere poetical endowment
and the significance of their position in history.
One may stand upon the higher pedestal, and the other
may have the sweeter voice.</p>

<p>In one point of view, Dante’s figure is the most
imposing of any poet’s; for, intensely local as he is,
he yet interprets all mediæval Europe. When, however,
he is compared with his closest analogue, Milton,
simply as a poet, it is not so clear that the comparison
is to his advantage. The great characteristics which
chiefly discriminate him from all other poets are an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
ineffable purity, such as we see in the early Italian
painters, and an intensity of minute description which
surpasses the similar performances of others, except
England may say with pride, Robert Browning’s, as
the work of the etching tool surpasses the work of
the pen. These gifts are best displayed upon a small
scale, and hence Dante’s cabinet pieces are more successful
than his vast pictures. They depend, too, in
the last resort upon the poet’s own fidelity of observation,
and hence his best delineations retrace what he has
actually seen. His general description of the<cite>Inferno</cite>
is more impressive from its unflinching realism than
from its imaginative sublimity. There is no grandeur
in his picture of Lucifer, though much quaint ingenuity,
Milton’s “not less than archangel ruined” tells us more
and affects us more profoundly than all Dante’s elaborate
word-painting. If Milton has nothing so beautiful as
the exquisite comparison of Beatrice to a bird awaiting
the dawn that she may gather food for her young,
neither has Dante anything so sublime as Milton’s
comparison of the flying fiend to a fleet discerned
afar off as hanging in the clouds, or of Satan equipped
for battle to the comet “that fires the length of
Ophiuchus huge.” The magnificent lines in which
Tennyson has celebrated the might and music of
Milton would seem inappropriate to Dante. In an
age when minute description is in fashion, Dante’s
virtuoso-like skill in graphic delineation has been favourable
to his renown; but a reaction must ensue when a
bolder and ampler style of handling is again appreciated
at its worth.</p>

<p>If, however, Dante is on the whole inferior to Milton
in poetry pure and simple, he is more important as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
representative of a great era of mankind. In him the
Middle Age lives as it does in its cathedrals; and when
the cathedrals have crumbled, the<cite>Divine Comedy</cite> will
be as fresh as it is now. Nor is this significance merely
historical or antiquarian. From the very first it was
appreciated by contemporaries. Repentant Florence
endowed lectures upon the<cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, and Boccaccio
was the first lecturer. In the next century Frezzi tries
to transpose it into another key; and Attavanti cites from
the pulpit <em>Dantes ille noster</em> as copiously and reverentially
as any of the Fathers. Even in the age of the Renaissance,
Pius the Fourth’s cardinals cap quotations from
Dante as the last notes of Palestrina’s Mass of Pope
Marcellus die down the aisles of St Peter’s. If he
afterwards fell into comparative abeyance for a time,
it must be remembered that Italy lay prostrate in the
seventeenth century, and that his genius did not sort
well with the especial mission assigned to her in the
eighteenth.</p>

<p>There can be no surer proof of Dante’s eternal vitality
than that the revival of his fame coincided with the
manifestation of ideas apparently the reverse of his own.
The French Revolution brought the mediæval poet into
fashion; and although his best expositors, whom it is
upon the whole most profitable to study, have been
those so nearly at his own intellectual standpoint as
Dean Church and Maria Rossetti, his most eloquent
champions have been those who, on a superficial view,
might seem to have least in common with him&mdash;Lamennais,
Shelley, Carlyle, Symonds, Mazzini, Leopardi. The
feelings of the man of the nineteenth century, attracted
by the divine and eternal elements in Dante with a
vehemence proportioned to his repulsion by the tran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>sient
and accidental, are thus powerfully expressed by
the greatest of living Italian poets:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER V<br />
<small>PETRARCH AS MAN OF LETTERS</small></h2>


<p>Although, hardly less than Shakespeare, born not for
an age but for all time, Dante was nevertheless in an
especial sense the poet of the mediæval period. The
vast advance which he effected in the poetic art had no
counterpart in a corresponding progress in the world
of intellect. Powerful as his mind was, it seemed as an
organ of thought rather architectural than creative; more
intent on combining the materials it found into the most
august edifice which their constitution admitted, than on
gaining new channels for feeling and intelligence. This
was to be the work of a mind far less original than
Dante’s, but happily placed at the confluence of mediæval
ideas with an element by which they were destined
to be submerged and transformed. In the year
1304, on the very day when Dante and his exiled companions
were making their desperate attempt to fight
their way back into Florence, F<small>RANCESCO</small> P<small>ETRARCA</small>,
the child of one of their number, was born a humanist
by the grace of God in the Tuscan town of Arezzo.
Six years after Dante’s death a casual encounter with
a lady who awoke the faculty of song within him made
the scholar the first poet of his age. But neither the
innate love of letters nor the awakened faculty of poetry
would have exalted Petrarch to the literary supremacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
he attained if he had not lived at the very juncture when
literature, hitherto cultivated in some of its branches for
mere utility, in others as an ornament of courtly life,
was beginning to revive as a profession. Dante, a statesman,
a philosopher, a prophet, was not in a true sense
a man of letters, and neither his ideals nor his contemporary
influence extended beyond the limits of Italy.
Petrarch was the first modern literary dictator, the first
author to receive the unanimous homage of a world
of culture. Such a world had not existed since the
decay of antique civilisation, and he may be said to
have been in a manner both its cause and its effect.
As the Erasmus, the Voltaire, the Goethe of his age,
he claims a more distinguished place in literary history
than even his exquisite poetry, much less his but relatively
ample erudition, could have secured for him.</p>

<p>Seven months after Petrarch’s birth his mother was
allowed to return to her patrimonial estate near Florence,
where she was sometimes secretly visited by her
husband. The elder Petrarca (or, as the name was then
spelt, Petracco) might have returned to his native city on
the same dishonourable terms as those offered to Dante,
but, like Dante, spurned them. Despairing of repatriation,
he betook himself to Avignon, then the seat of
the Papal Court, where he followed the profession of
the law.</p>

<p>Petrarch was successively educated at Carpentras, at
Montpellier, and at the University of Bologna, where
his father’s commands compelled him to the study of
jurisprudence. The death of his parent in 1326 recalled
him to Avignon, and restored him to letters. To qualify
himself for ecclesiastical preferment he received the
tonsure without taking orders, a step not unusual in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
those days, and devoted himself entirely to literature.
The “Babylonish captivity” of the Church at Avignon,
violently as he denounces it in his writings, was highly
favourable to his interests, for it helped him to the
patronage of Cardinal Colonna, whose brother, afterwards
Bishop of Lombès, he had known intimately at
the University of Bologna. It was probably from this
source that he derived means to mingle with gay society
and indulge in the fashionable follies of eccentric costume,
which he ridicules in his later writings; for
letters as yet afforded him no sure subsistence, and his
scanty patrimony had been embezzled or wasted by his
guardians. On April 6, 1327<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, occurred the most momentous
event of his life, his vision of Laura in church
“at the hour of prime,” which made him a poet. But
for this, he might never have written in the vernacular.
Cicero and Virgil, his literary idols, enjoined Latin composition,
to which in all probability he would have exclusively
addicted himself but for the need of celebrating
Laura in a language which she understood.</p>


<p>The question of Laura’s identity will be best considered
along with the poems devoted to her praise
and her adorer’s passion. Neither love nor society,
meanwhile, kept Petrarch from letters, and his reputation
waxed daily. He displayed a happy faculty for
maintaining relations with the great, equally honourable
to both parties, exempt alike from presumption and
servility. In 1330 he spent a considerable time with
Bishop Colonna at his Pyrenean diocese of Lombès,
and on his return was formally enrolled as a member
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>of the Cardinal’s household. His residence at Avignon
made him known to the learned English prelate, Richard
de Bury, and other distinguished visitors at the Papal
Court, and he began to enjoy the favour of Robert, King
of Naples. His vernacular poetry, though far inferior to
that which he was destined to produce, was nevertheless
making him and Laura famous, for he exclaims in an
early sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Blest all songs and music that have spread<br />
Her laud afar.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1"> he made a journey to Paris, Belgium, and the
Rhine, of which he has given us a lively account in his
correspondence, and which produced at least one sonnet
which showed that by this time he wanted but little of
perfection:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Through wild inhospitable woods I rove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where fear attends even on the soldier’s way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dreadless of ill; for nought can me affray</span><br />
Saving that Sun which shines by light of Love:<br />
And chant, as idly carolling I move,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her, whom not Heaven itself can keep away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne in my eyes; and ladies I survey</span><br />
Encircling her, who oaks and beeches prove.<br />
Her voice in sighing breeze and rustling bough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaf I seem to hear, and birds, and rills</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Murmuring the while they slip through grassy green.</span><br />
Rarely have silences and lonely thrills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of overshadowing forests pleased as now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except for my own Sun too little seen.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">In the same year Petrarch graduated as a patriotic
poet by composing his fine Latin metrical epistle on the
woes of Italy. In 1335 he received from the Pope a
canonry in the cathedral of his patron the Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
Lombès. In 1336 he achieved his celebrated ascent of
Mount Ventoux, which marks an era as the inauguration
of mountain-climbing for pleasure’s sake. In 1336 and
1337 he undertook his first journey to Rome, which he
found in a most lamentable condition from rapine and
civil war. Attributing this to the absence of the Popes
in France, he began his long series of exhortations to
them to return, to which, being throughout his lifetime
Frenchmen, they naturally turned deaf ears. Hence in
a measure the disgust with Avignon which led him to
seclude himself more and more in Vaucluse (<em>shut valley</em>),
the picturesque retreat on the Sorga whither he betook
himself in 1337, a beautiful description of which by
Ugo Foscolo may be read in Reeve’s biography. His
adoration of Laura had not prevented his contracting
less spiritual ties, for two children were born to him
about this time.</p>

<p>Petrarch’s rural leisure was largely employed in the
composition of a Latin history of Rome, which can
have had no critical value, but would have been deeply
interesting as exhibiting the classical feeling of the representative
of the early Renaissance. He ultimately
destroyed it, and turned to the composition of his Latin
epic on the Punic war,<cite>Africa</cite>, for and from which
he long expected immortality. His detestation of the
Papal Court breaks out about this time in some powerful
sonnets. His Italian poems, meanwhile, had made their
way with the world to a degree surprising in an age
unacquainted with printing. In 1340 he received on the
same day the offer of the poetic laurel from the cities of
Paris and Rome. Deciding for the latter, he embarked
at Marseilles in February 1341, voyaged to Naples, received
signal marks of favour from the King, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
repairing to Rome, was invested with the laurel by the
Senator of the city, April 8, 1341. From this day the
history of modern literature as a recognised power may
be said to date. Ere his return at the beginning of
1342, he had finished his<cite>Africa</cite>, and bought a house at
Parma to give himself a footing in his native land.</p>

<p>In 1343 Petrarch was again in Italy, discharging an
important diplomatic mission with which he had been
entrusted by the new Pope Clement VI. to the Court of
Naples; the state of which he describes in dark colours,
not too dark, as the history of the hapless Queen Joanna,
Robert’s successor, sufficiently proves. He nevertheless
rendered himself acceptable to her, and, his mission
honourably discharged, repaired to Parma, where (1344)
he wrote the first of his great political odes,<cite>Italia mia
benche il parlar sia indarno</cite>, and whence he was chased
by civil discord. He did not, however, return to Avignon
until towards the end of this year. The next few years
were chiefly spent in literary occupations, the most remarkable
of which was the composition (1347) of his
ode to the Tribune Cola di Rienzi, in whom he saw the
deliverer of his country. Petrarch’s course was not free
from the imputation of ingratitude to his old friends
and patrons, the Colonna family; yet it would have been
worse to have been silent at the prospect, however brief
and delusive, of the resurrection of Rome. Other poets
before him had written on Italian politics, but none, not
even Dante, had so exalted their theme by eloquence and
ennobling largeness of view:</p>

<p class="p1">The next year, 1348, was one of havoc and desolation
for Europe, through the ravages of the Black Death,
which swept away a larger proportion of her inhabitants
than any similar visitation recorded in history. Laura
was among the victims, dying on April 6, the anniversary
of her meeting with Petrarch. Cardinal Colonna, his
chief patron since the death of the Bishop of Lombès,
was also carried off on July 3. Nothing can be added
to his own words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>The lofty Column and the Laurel green,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What scarce stow striving years accumulate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So lightly in a morning to be spent!</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">Petrarch’s demeanour after the death of his Laura
presents a strong contrast to Dante’s after the like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
bereavement, nor does he suffer by the comparison.
Nothing can surpass the poignancy of Dante’s first grief
as depicted in the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>; but he soon forms another
tie, and though the memory of Beatrice is ever
with him, the human affection sublimates more and more
into an abstract spiritual type. Petrarch’s utterances,
on the other hand, wear at first something of a conventional
semblance, but constantly increase in depth and
tenderness, and while he remains the humanist in his
studies and the diplomatist in active life, his poetry, as
of old, is all but monopolised by his one passion. As
his attachment to Laura in her life had been compatible
with frequent and long absences, so her death did not
prevent him from discharging the public functions fitly
entrusted to the most eminent scholar of his age.</p>

<p>Although he often expresses in his verse his delight
in revisiting the banks of the Sorga, his life from this
time was chiefly spent in Upper Italy, much occupied
by the discharge of diplomatic commissions from the
Pope, the Venetian Republic, and the Lords of Milan
and Padua; constantly appealing to the Avignon Popes
to terminate the “Babylonish captivity” of the Church;
vexed by the undutifulness of his natural son, but finding
comfort in his daughter; indefatigable in collecting
and transcribing manuscripts; giving, though himself
ignorant of Greek, a powerful impulse to Hellenic studies
by commissioning a Latin translation of Homer; producing
many of his most pleasing minor Latin writings;
and throwing his last energies into the apotheosis of
Laura in his<cite>Trionfi</cite>. He went to Paris to congratulate
John, King of France, on his release from captivity in
England; and was present at the marriage of Lionel,
Duke of Clarence, at Milan, where or soon afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
he may possibly have encountered Chaucer. Boccaccio
followed him with respectful homage, and almost his
last literary labour was the Latin translation of the
Florentine’s tale of<cite>Patient Griselda</cite>. The last four
years of his life, though with many intervals of public
business, were chiefly spent in his retirement at Arquá,
a village in the Euganean Hills, where death overtook
him as he bent over a book, July 20, 1374. He
had virtually finished the<cite>Trionfi</cite> about three months
previously.</p>

<p>We have devoted more space to the biography of
Petrarch than to that of Dante, because, although Dante
towers above him as a poet, Petrarch is the more important
figure in Italian literary history. Dante stands
alone: venerated as he was by his countrymen, and
not wholly destitute of imitators, he yet founded no
school, and his influence on the development of the
Italian intellect is slight in comparison with Petrarch’s.
Together with the great schoolman who quitted the world
as he entered it, he sums up the Middle Age, which
in him and Aquinas attains its highest development.
Petrarch, on the other hand, is the representative Italian.
He does not, like Dante, deliver, but is himself a prophecy:
the future of Italian culture is prefigured in him.
He was also the first to bestow on Italy an unquestioned
supremacy in the world of literature, and was the
earliest restorer of the republic of letters, a conception
extinct in the ages of barbarism. In this restoration,
transcending the limits of his own country, his Latin
writings were necessarily more influential than his
Italian<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, and although they do not properly belong to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>our subject, their great importance in the history of
culture entitles them to a few words.</p>

<p>The chief causes of Petrarch’s failure as a Latin poet
are evident. In the infancy of vernacular literature it
was not sufficiently understood that compositions in a
dead language, however exquisite, must fail to bestow
immortality. Nor could Petrarch himself be fully aware
how impossible it was to write like a Roman poet in the
new dawn of reviving classical studies. It took two
centuries of culture to produce a Vida and a Sannazaro,
and if their names are undying, the same can hardly be
said of their Latin works. But there was a deeper reason.
Petrarch attempted epic composition without epic inspiration.
His genius was entirely lyric, and his poetry
has little value except where it palpitates with lyrical feeling.
When he writes on the misfortunes of his country,
he is a poet even when writing in Latin; and his great
Latin epic, the<cite>Africa</cite>, too often tame, notwithstanding
its true natural feeling, sometimes, especially when near
the end of the poem he speaks of himself, kindles into
poetry. The Latin verses placed by Coleridge on the
half-title of his own love-poems in<cite>Sibylline Leaves</cite> are
almost as exquisite as the tenderest passages of the
<cite>Canzoniere</cite> itself<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>:</p>


<div class="poetry-container pw25">

</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">Although Petrarch preferred Latin to Italian in the
abstract, and even affected to undervalue Dante because
his chief works were composed in the vulgar tongue, he
acknowledged that he had missed the perfection in Latin
which he was conscious of having attained in Italian. His
only prose-writings with any significance for us now are
the autobiographic. Some of his ethical disquisitions,
however, if they had come down from classic times, would
have been regarded as precious monuments of antiquity.
The most important of these is the<cite>De Remediis utriusque
Fortunæ</cite> (1356), in two books, the first treating of the
snares of prosperity, the second arming the soul against
adversity. The reflections are forcibly expressed, but in
themselves somewhat trite. His tract<cite>De sua et aliorum
Ignorantia</cite> (1361), on the other hand, abounds with
energy, and gives a lively picture of the strife in his
bosom between the humanistic scholar and the orthodox
Christian. More vital still, at least after some pedantic
digressions have been discarded, is his<cite>Secretum, sive de
Contemptu Mundi</cite> (1342), where the conflict in his mind
between the sense of moral obligation and his passion
for Laura is so depicted as to render him the prototype
of Rousseau, and entitle us to derive one of the most
characteristic departments of modern literature from him.
He is no less the father of modern autobiography by the
slight but charming sketch he has left of himself in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
<cite>Epistola ad Posteros</cite>, prefixed to the general collection of
his letters. It was a great discovery that the external
circumstances of a remarkable life are not the only ones
worth relating.</p>

<p>The most important of all Petrarch’s Latin works is
his collection of Epistles, partly formed by himself in his
lifetime, and greatly enriched by the diligence of recent
editors, especially Fracassetti. These are not only of
high interest from the portrait they convey of the man
himself, equally as an individual and as the ideal type of
the man of letters, but form a perpetual commentary on
the manners and customs of his age. Many, though
composed by Petrarch, are written in the names of
sovereigns or public bodies; others are letters of warm
encouragement or warmer remonstrance to popes, emperors,
and others who then seemed, but only seemed,
to have the world’s destinies in their hands. In all his
correspondence with the great, Petrarch, like Dante,
appears as the idealist, inspired by the remembrance
of antiquity, and urging upon the rulers of the day a
more exalted course of action than suited their dispositions,
or, it must be admitted, was compatible with the
circumstances of the time. They on their parts seem to
have appreciated the honour of being lectured by such a
man, and to have permitted him to say what he pleased,
satisfied that he could exert no practical influence upon
the course of politics. Printing and the liberty of the
press have now made the humblest newspaper scribe
more potent than the first man of letters of the fourteenth
century. Some of Petrarch’s epistles are of
unique interest, such as the description of his ascent of
Mount Ventoux, of the great tempest at Naples, and of
the apparition of the ghost of the Bishop of Lombès, the
first circumstantial narrative of the kind, and perhaps to
this day the best authenticated.</p>

<p>Petrarch’s encouragement of classical study is not the
least among his titles to fame. He was the Erasmus of
his age in so far as the rudimentary condition of criticism
allowed, and, in so far as his means permitted, its
Mæcenas. He discovered Cicero’s epistles to Atticus,
and, by his own statement, which there seems no sufficient
reason for rejecting, had at one time the lost treatise
<cite>De Gloria</cite> in his hands. He yearned towards Homer
and Plato, whom he could not read in the original, but
perused in translations. The fullest information respecting
his literary tastes, the extent of his library and
his knowledge of the classics, his borrowings and loans
of manuscripts, his copyists and his bindings, will be
found in the excellent monograph of Pierre de Nolhac,
<cite>Pétrarque et l’Humanisme</cite> (Paris, 1892). Many manuscripts
known to have belonged to him still exist, chiefly
in French public libraries. The story of the destruction
of his books by the neglect of the Venetians is groundless;
they ought to have been made over to the Republic
after his death, but they never reached Venice. The
Aldine Italic type is said to have been modelled after
Petrarch’s handwriting, and the first book in which it
was used was an edition of the author whom he principally
annotated, Virgil.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>PETRARCH AND LAURA</small></h2>


<p>Petrarch’s activity as a scholar claimed so much
larger a portion of his time and thoughts than his
<cite>Canzoniere</cite>, and the bulk of the latter, considerable as
it is, is so small in comparison with that of the mass
of his writings, that Symonds seems almost justified in
depreciating his work as an Italian lyrist in comparison
with his influence as a humanist. Yet Petrarch’s
Latin works were like the falling rain, which passes
away as a distinct existence, though long invisibly operative
as a fertilising agent; while his poetry, confined
to a definite channel by the restraints of consummate
diction and style, flows in a crystal stream for ever.
Here and there in other men’s books, no doubt, an
isolated love-strain of higher quality may be found, but
nothing approaching the<cite>Canzoniere</cite> as an epitomised
encyclopædia of passion. The best is transcendently
excellent; and if many of the pieces, especially near
the beginning, might well have been dispensed with as
far as their individual desert is concerned, they still have
their value as notes in a great harmony. As his translator
Cayley well remarks, “No poet has so fully
represented the whole world of love in every tone
and variety of play and earnest, delight and pain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
enthusiasm and self-reproach, expostulation, rebellion,
submission, adoration, and friendship, or regret and
religious consolations leading gradually to another
sphere of hope and devotion.” One thing only is
wanting to this encyclopædia of emotion, the rapture
of possession. This was not for Petrarch: throughout
the first part he is the yearning suitor, throughout the
second the dejected mourner. Hardly another man
ever sighed or wept with so much constancy or so
little recompense.</p>

<p>Who was the object of this unique passion and perpetual
grief? So obscure are the circumstances that
some have deemed Laura, like the candlemaker’s widow
at Père la Chaise, “une métaphore, un symbole.” Petrarch’s
friend, the Bishop of Lombès, suspected as
much, but Petrarch indignantly protested, and after a
while refuted the surmise by a manuscript note in his
Virgil, to be treated more fully hereafter. Apart from
this, it seems strange that scepticism should have survived
his avowal, on a serious occasion, the composition
of his address to posterity; where he speaks of his affection
for Laura as his sole incitement to worthy fame,
and of her own reputation as something entirely independent
of his praises. “What little I am, such as
it is, I am through her; and if I have attained to any
fame or glory, I had never possessed it if the few grains
of virtue which Nature had deposited in my soul had
not been cultivated by her with such noble affection.
What else did I desire in my youth than to please
her, and her alone, who alone had pleased me?” The
strongest testimony, however, is that of the poems
themselves, which are full of traits and descriptions
evidently derived from real life, and which would lose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
all their charm if they could be deemed imaginary.
Take this for example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>As Love pursued me in the wonted glade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wary as he, who weening foe to find,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guards every pass, and looks before, behind,</span><br />
I stood in mail of ancient thought arrayed:<br />
When, sideways turned, I saw by sudden shade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun impeded, and, on earth outlined</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her shape, who, if aright conceives my mind,</span><br />
Meetest for immortality was made.<br />
I said unto my heart, 'Why dost thou fear?’<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But ere my heart could open to my thought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beams whereby I melt shone all around;</span><br />
And, as when flash by thunder-peal is caught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My eyes encounter of those eyes most dear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smiling welcome simultaneous found.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">How natural and pleasing if the incident be real! and
how marvellous the poetical power which can raise such
an edifice out of such a trifle! On the other hand, how
insipid if the little event, instead of a ripple on the surface
of life arrested by the poet’s art ere it has had time
to pass into nothingness, be but a fiction to enable him
to say a pretty thing! The author of so frigid a contrivance
could never have been the author of the<cite>Canzoniere</cite>.</p>

<p>But though Laura’s actual existence is certain, her
identity is a subject of everlasting controversy. The
popular belief near to Petrarch’s own day is expressed
by an anonymous biographer, who, writing, as is thought,
near the end of the fourteenth century, calls her Loretta,
and, by adding that the Pope offered Petrarch a dispensation
from his ecclesiastical vows in order to marry
her, clearly indicates that she was believed to be a single
woman. The Abbé de Sade, however, in his life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
Petrarch, published in 1767, adduces much documentary
and other evidence to identify her with Laura, born De
Noves, wife of Hugo de Sade, and an ancestress of the
Abbé’s own. With one important exception, to be mentioned
shortly, the Abbé’s proofs are of little weight;
they establish the existence of a Laura de Sade, but by
no means that she was Petrarch’s Laura. An account
of the discovery of Laura de Sade’s tomb in 1533, authenticated
by some very bad verses attributed to Petrarch
found within it, although itself genuine, evidently records
a clumsy fabrication.</p>

<p>One advantage the Abbé’s theory certainly has, the
production of an unanswerable reason why Petrarch
did not marry Laura; but, on the other hand, his
ecclesiastical orders might be a sufficient impediment.
The Papal dispensation which might have relieved
him of them must surely have relieved him of his preferments
also; and if the story is authentic, the offer
came in all probability from Clement VI., the Pope
by whom he was chiefly favoured, who did not attain
the tiara until 1342, fifteen years after his first acquaintance
with Laura, when Laura’s health seems to have
been much impaired, and he may well have thought the
time gone by. The objections to his suit having been
addressed to a married woman seem almost insurmountable.
If his flame was Laura de Sade, she was the
mother of a very numerous family, and it appears all
but incredible that he should have inscribed so much
verse to her both in her lifetime and after her death,
and discussed his passion so freely in his Dialogae without
the slightest allusion to husband or children; or
that the identity of a lady holding so high a position, and
celebrated in verses read all over Italy, should so long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
have remained obscure; or that he should have enjoyed
such freedom of access to her as he evidently did. The
idea, moreover, seems quite inconsistent with the tenor
of the celebrated sonnet,<cite>Tranquillo porto avea mostrato
Amore</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Love had at length a tranquil port displayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To travailed soul, long vexed by toil and teen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In calm maturity, where naked seen</span><br />
Is Vice, and Virtue in fair garb arrayed.<br />
Bare to her eyes my heart should now be laid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disquieted no more their peace serene&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Death! what harvest of long years hath been</span><br />
Ruin by thee in one brief moment made!<br />
The hour when unreproved I might invoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her chaste ear’s favour, and disburden there</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My breast of fond and ancient thought, drew nigh:</span><br />
And she, perchance, considering as I spoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each bloomless face and either’s silvered hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some blessed word had uttered with a sigh.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The thought manifestly is, that if Laura had lived a
short time longer their intimacy would have given no
occasion for scandal. This might be true of an unmarried
lady or a widow, hardly of a wife. The sonnet
also proves that Petrarch and Laura were nearly of an
age, refuting Vellutello’s opinion on this point. Salvatore
Betti, moreover, has found another Laura, fulfilling, in his
estimation, all requisites as well as the Abbé de Sade’s.</p>

<p>It must, notwithstanding, be acknowledged that there
is one piece of documentary evidence almost sufficient
to prove the Abbé’s theory in the teeth of all objections,
could we but be certain of its genuineness. This is the
will of Laura de Sade, made in a condition of extreme
sickness on April 3, 1348. We know on Petrarch’s own
authority that his Laura died on April 6, for the genuineness
of the note in his Virgil where he records this fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
is now regarded as incontestable. That two ladies of
the name of Laura were dying at or near Avignon at
the same time is clearly improbable. But is the will
itself authentic? or may it not have been altered or interpolated?
The Abbé cites it as a document in his
family archives; its existence is attested by several persons
in the eighteenth century; but it does not appear
to have been submitted to the scrutiny of any expert,
nor can we learn whether such an examination has ever
been made since, or whether the testament is now producible<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
Should its authenticity ever be demonstrated,
but hardly otherwise, we shall be almost compelled to
embrace a belief liable in every other point of view to
formidable objections.</p>


<p>Although Laura, as depicted by Petrarch, is the most
ethereal feminine ideal ever conceived, his passion was
certainly not of the Platonic kind. The contrary has
been asserted, but is contradicted by every page of the
<cite>Canzoniere</cite>, which is full of reproaches to Laura for her
cruelty, incomprehensible if she was not withholding
very substantial favours. He certainly did not want for
encouragements of a more spiritual nature:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>The mist of pallor in such beauteous wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetness of her smile did overscreen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That my thrilled heart, upon my visage seen,</span><br />
Sprang to encounter it in swift surprise.<br />
How soul by soul is scanned in Paradise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then knew I, unto whom disclosed had been</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That thought pathetic by all gaze unseen</span><br />
Save mine, who solely for such sight have eyes.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>All look angelical, all tender gest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That e’er on man by grace of woman beamed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At side of this had shown discourtesy.</span><br />
The gentle visage, modestly depressed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Earthward, inquired with silence, as meseemed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Who draws my faithful friend away from me?'</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Long after this, which surely should have satisfied a
Platonic lover, he is looking forward to a more perfect
consummation of his wishes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Love sends me messengers of gentle thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since days of yore our trusty go-between,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And comforts me, who ne’er, he saith, have been</span><br />
So near as now to hopes fruition brought.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">What hope’s fruition was we learn from numerous
sonnets composed after the death of Laura, in which the
poet expresses his thankfulness that his mistress did not
yield to his too ardent entreaties, but kept him in order
by her frowns, a function attributed to her even in the
first book of sonnets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>O happy arts of excellent effect!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I labouring with the tongue, she with the glance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have glory there, and virtue here bestowed.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Laura’s attitude towards Petrarch seems not ill expressed
in the sonnet composed in the eighteenth
century by Ippolito Pindemonte:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>To thee, immortal lady lowly laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Sorga glassed thy loveliness divine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I bow in worship; not because was thine</span><br />
The beauty solely for the coffin made;<br />
But for the soul that animating swayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, cold and colder growing, did incline</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brighter and brighter yet to soar and shine</span><br />
Thy lover’s flame of passion unallayed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span><br />
For certes his lament had seemed misplaced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And much the pathos of his music marred,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had not his lady been so very chaste:</span><br />
Come, grateful Italy, with fond regard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To kiss the tomb by such a tenant graced,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bless the dust that gave thee such a bard.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">This peculiar relation of Laura to Petrarch as a
monitress, no less than an object of adoration, goes
far to establish the reality of his passion, which is
exactly that which men frequently entertain for women
a little older than themselves, and whom they deem
in some measure or some respect their superiors. He
feels himself ennobled by his love, a sentiment expressed
with great force in the tenth sonnet, one of
the earliest, and in many others, especially the beautiful
Sonnet clii.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Soul, that such various things with various art<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Following the seemly step and ray divine.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">We do not know whether Petrarch had written any
poetry before he tuned his lyre to hymn Laura. His
beginnings (the exquisite initial sonnet being in fact the
last written of any) are at first feeble and uncertain. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
is not until arriving at Sonnet xxii. that he strikes a note
worthy of his mature power, and he continues unequal
up to about Sonnet lx., when masterpieces begin to occur
with frequency; from this point onwards the proportion
of absolutely insignificant poems is comparatively
small. The interspersed sestines and ballate add little
to his reputation; not so the canzoni, which are among
his noblest productions. Traces of a chronological
arrangement are evident; thus his secession to the
Sorga gives birth to a group of sonnets with which
those denouncing the Papal Court at Avignon are intimately
connected; and in general the poems show a
continuous development of style, but there are some
signal exceptions. Towards the end of the first book
his Muse would seem in danger of flagging, were she
not stimulated by forebodings of the death of Laura.
The pieces expressing this apprehension form a well-marked
group, which may be associated with the doubts
and fears which, after Laura’s decease, he tells us beset
him on his last parting with her (1347):</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>The lovely eyes, now in supernal sphere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bright with the light whence life and safety rain,</span><br />
Leaving mine mendicant and mourning here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flashed with new mood they seemed to entertain,</span><br />
Saying to these: Take comfort, friends most dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not here but elsewhere shall we meet again.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Mestica, the most critical of Petrarch’s editors, seems
to think that he wrote no more on Laura in her lifetime
after the great spiritual change which he supposes him
to have undergone in 1343, when he wrote his dialogue
with St. Augustine. We see but slight evidence of any
such metamorphosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The second book of the<cite>Canzoniere</cite>, comprising the
pieces composed after the death of Laura, resembles
the first in their comparative inferiority at the beginning,
after a fine introductory sonnet. Either Petrarch’s grief
had paralysed his powers, or he had not fully realised
his loss, or he had not yet hit upon the fitting tone.
In a short time, however, he regains his true self, and
the second part is generally deemed to excel the first, as
pathos excels passion. It is not that the artist is more
consummate, but the capabilities of his instrument are
greater. The poems generally fall into two groups&mdash;laments
for Laura’s loss, or consolation derived from
the realisation of her presence on earth or in heaven.
An example of each must be given:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>The eyes whose praise I penned with glowing thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And countenance and limbs and all fair worth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sundered me from men of mortal birth,</span><br />
From them dissevered, in myself distraught;<br />
The clustering locks with golden glory fraught;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sudden-shining smile, as angels’ mirth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wonted to make a paradise on earth;</span><br />
Are now a little dust, that feels not aught.<br />
Still have I life, who rail and rage at it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lorn of Love’s light that solely life endears;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mastless before the hurricane I flit.</span><br />
Be this my last of lays to mortal ears;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dried is the ancient fountain of my wit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all my music melted into tears.</span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>Exalted by my thought to regions where<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I found whom earthly quest hath never shown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Love hath rule ’twixt fourth and second zone;</span><br />
More beautiful I found her, less austere.<br />
Clasping my hand, she said, 'Behold the sphere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where we shall dwell, if Wish hath truly known.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am, who wrung from thee such bitter moan;</span><br />
Whose sun went down ere evening did appear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span><br />
My bliss, too high for man to understand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet needs thee, and the veil that so did please.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now unto dust for briefest season given.’</span><br />
Why ceased she speaking? why withdrew her hand?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, rapt to ecstasy by words like these,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little I wanted to have stayed in Heaven.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>


<p class="p1">This latter mood is in general the more characteristic
of Petrarch. Towards the end it prevails more and
more, but the same falling-off is observable as in the
former book. Petrarch’s religious sonnets are exquisite
when they involve a direct vision of Laura, but otherwise
they are apt to become tame and conventional. It is
almost a pity that the most notable exception should
ever have been written, though it ranks among his
masterpieces:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Ever do I lament the days gone by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When adoration of a mortal thing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bound me to earth, though gifted with a wing</span><br />
That haply had upraised me to the sky.<br />
Thou, unto whom unveiled my errors lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Celestial, unbeheld, eternal King,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Help to the frail and straying spirit bring,</span><br />
And lack of grace with grace of Thine supply.<br />
So shall the life in storm and warfare spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In peaceful haven close; if here in vain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her tarrying, seemly her departure be.</span><br />
Aid me to live the little life yet lent;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Expiring strength with Thy strong arm sustain:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou knowest I have hope in none but Thee.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Were this more than a passing mood, it would be
painful indeed that Petrarch should have lived to deem
his devotion to Laura misspent, and nothing short of
ludicrous that he should have accused himself of missing
by his<cite>Canzoniere</cite> the renown which epics or tragedies
might have ensured him. Such a passing mood it must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
have been, for it is contradicted by the succeeding
pieces. The book concludes with an impassioned hymn
to the Virgin, which may have suggested to Goethe the
analogous conclusion of<cite>Faust</cite>.</p>

<p>The<cite>Canzoniere</cite> is completed by the<cite>Trionfi</cite>, allegorical
shows entirely in the taste of the Middle Ages, which
we shall find repeated in Francesco Colonna’s<cite>Polifilo</cite>.
Petrarch successively sings the might of Love, Chastity,
Death, Fame, Time, and Eternity, set forth in the long
processions of their captives or votaries. A certain circumscription
is essential to the full display of Petrarch’s
genius, and<cite>terza rima</cite>, a metre favourable to diffuseness,
does not exhibit his powers to such advantage as
the severe restriction of his sonnets and canzoni. The
poem, nevertheless, if a little garrulous, charms by
deep feeling and a succession of delightful if not transcendent
beauties. The finest portion is the Triumph of
Death, when Laura appears, and addresses the poet to
much the same effect as in his sonnets written after her
decease. “L’on est vraiment touché de voir que dans
un âge avancé Pétrarque ne se consolait encore de
l’avoir perdue qu’en se rappelant et se retraçant dans
ses vers tout ce qui lui faisait croire que Laura en effet
l’avait aimé” (Ginguené). It was begun in 1357, and is
not entirely complete, though Petrarch continued to add
and retouch until within a very short time of his death.
The last lines relate to Laura, who, present or absent, is
always the inspiration of the poem. Petrarch evidently
wrote greatly under the influence of his reminiscences
of Dante, and this may account for his unwillingness,
frequently attributed to unworthy jealousy, to concern
himself with his predecessor in his latter years. He
knew that Dante’s spirit was more potent than his,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
and feared to be subjugated by it, as has happened to
many. He has himself been imitated by Shelley in the
<cite>Triumph of Life</cite>.</p>

<p>The odes with which the<cite>Canzoniere</cite> is interspersed
are no less beautiful than the sonnets, but are less
adapted for quotation, since it is impossible to give any
one in its entirety, and they must greatly suffer by
abridgement. There is, however, a certain completeness
in the first three stanzas of<cite>Chiare, fresche, e dolci acque</cite>,
excellently translated by Leigh Hunt:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw30">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Clear, fresh, and dulcet streams,<br />
Which the fair shape who seems<br />
To me sole woman, haunted at noon-tide;<br />
Fair bough, so gently fit<br />
(I sigh to think of it),<br />
Which lent a pillow to her lovely side;<br />
And turf, and flowers bright-eyed,<br />
O’er which her folded gown<br />
Flowed like an angel’s down;<br />
And you, oh holy air and hushed,<br />
Where first my heart at her sweet glances gushed;<br />
Give ear, give ear with one consenting,<br />
To my last words, my last, and my lamenting.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>If’tis my fate below,<br />
And Heaven will have it so,<br />
That love must close these dying eyes in tears,<br />
May my poor dust be laid<br />
In middle of your shade,<br />
While my soul naked mounts to its own spheres.<br />
The thought would calm my fears,<br />
When taking, out of breath,<br />
The doubtful step of death;<br />
For never could my spirit find<br />
A stiller port after the stormy wind,<br />
Nor in more calm, abstracted bourne<br />
Slip from my travailed flesh, and from my bones outworn<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
Perhaps, some future hour,<br />
To her accustomed bower<br />
Might come the untamed, and yet the gentle she;<br />
And where she saw me first,<br />
Might turn with eyes athirst<br />
And kinder joy to look again for me;<br />
Then, oh, the charity!<br />
Seeing amid the stones<br />
The earth that held my bones,<br />
A sigh for very love at last<br />
Might ask of Heaven to pardon me the past;<br />
And Heaven itself could not say nay,<br />
As with her gentle veil she wiped the tears away.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Not much need be said of Petrarch’s character,
whether as poet, scholar, or man. As a poet he deserves
to be numbered among the few who have attained
absolute perfection within a certain sphere; to whom
within these limits nothing can be added, though much
may be taken away. The subtraction of the trivial or
fantastic from Petrarch’s verse leaves, nevertheless, a
mass of love-poetry transcending in amount no less than
in loveliness all poetry of the same class from the pen
of any other man. If immortality is deservedly awarded
to a single masterpiece like the<cite>Burial of Sir John Moore</cite>
or the<cite>Pervigilium Veneris</cite>, it should not be difficult to estimate
his claims whose similar masterpieces are counted by
scores. Perhaps the greatest of his beauties is the complete
naturalness of his ceaseless succession of thoughts
transcendently exquisite. If Petrarch has not the thrilling
note or transparent spirituality of Dante, his perfect
form represents a higher stage of artistic development&mdash;too
high, indeed, to be maintained by his successors. A
just parallel might be drawn between the three great
sonnet-writers of the Latin peoples, Dante, Petrarch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
Camoens; the three orders of architecture, Doric, Ionic,
Corinthian; and the three great ancient dramatists.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Petrarch does not appear as
the representative poet of the mediæval or of any other
period. Horace and Ovid would have admired him as
much as his contemporaries did, and he is as fresh and
bright in the nineteenth as in the fourteenth century.
Many have pursued him, none have overtaken him.
His prose works, on the contrary, bear the stamp of
their age, and exist for ours mainly as curiosities and
documentary illustrations of bygone manners and ways
of thinking. This was inevitable; he could not have
been the literary sovereign of his age had he been very
greatly in advance of it. He looked down upon it sufficiently
to dislike it, as he tells us, and prepare a better.
As a man he had shining virtues and few faults, except
such as are almost inseparable from the characters of
poets, orators, and lovers, and which men like Dante
only avoid at the cost of less amiable failings. His
nearest parallel is perhaps with Cicero, and would appear
closer if Petrarch had, or Cicero had not, been called
upon to take a highly responsible part in public affairs.</p>

<p>Of Petrarch’s vast influence upon English poetry since
the time of Wyatt and Surrey, who may be justly called
his disciples, it is needless to say anything, except that
it is even more to be traced in the general refinement of
diction than by the imitation of particular passages.</p>

<p>The best critical edition is Mestica’s, founded mainly
upon scrupulous examination of a manuscript partly
written by Petrarch himself, partly by an amanuensis
under his direction. It may almost be wished that
Mestica had not such good authority for some of his
disturbances of time-hallowed readings. By much the
best exegetical commentary is Leopardi’s, a model of
pregnant conciseness, and invaluable for clearing up
difficulties, although frequently proffering explanation
where explanation seems needless. The late Henry
Reeve’s English biography, though condensed, is fully
adequate. The appreciation of the Petrarchan sonnet-forms,
never to be tampered with without detriment, has
been mainly promoted in England by the late Charles
Tomlinson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>BOCCACCIO</small></h2>


<p>If the works of the third great Italian writer cannot
be compared to Dante’s for sublimity, or to Petrarch’s
for perfection of style, the most important of them is
of even greater significance in the history of culture.
By his<cite>Decameron</cite> G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>OCCACCIO</small><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> endowed his
country with a classic prose, and won for himself a
unique place as the first modern novelist.</p>

<p>Boccaccio always speaks of himself as “of Certaldo,”
a small Tuscan town under Florentine dominion, where
he possessed some properly. It would seem, however,
from his own expressions, not to have been his birthplace.
This was most probably Florence. The early
legend of his birth at Paris rests upon a too absolute
identification of himself with a character in his<cite>Ameto</cite>.
His birth probably took place in 1313; and, if not early
orphaned of his mother, he must have been an illegitimate
child. His father, a Florentine merchant of the prudent
and thrifty type, had him taught grammar and arithmetic,
sent him into a counting-house at thirteen, and four
years afterwards placed him with a mercantile firm at
Naples. When, after two years, the youth’s distaste to
trade proved insuperable, the father made him study law
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>at the Neapolitan University. It is not likely that he
gave much attention to so dry a subject amid the distractions
of the lively city, where he was insensibly
receiving the inspiration of his future poetry and fiction.</p>


<p>Notwithstanding the accusation of stinginess brought
against his father, Boccaccio must apparently have possessed
considerable means, mixing in the best society
of Naples. He probably owed much to the Florentine
extraction of Nicola Acciajuoli, a leading personage, and
subsequently Grand Seneschal of the kingdom. By
1338 he had progressed so far as to fall in love with
the lady he has celebrated as Fiammetta, but whose
real name was Maria, putative daughter of the Count
of Aquino, but generally believed to be the offspring
of King Robert himself. Fiammetta was married. The
degree in which she returned his passion is uncertain,
but she appears to have exerted considerable influence
upon his career as an author. He composed the<cite>Filocopo</cite>
for her entertainment about 1339, and the close of his
activity as an imaginative writer about twelve years afterwards
coincides with the probable period of her death.
<cite>Ameto</cite> and<cite>Fiammetta</cite>, in both of which she is celebrated
were written after Boccaccio’s return to Florence
whither he was recalled by his unsympathising father
about 1340; here the wild oats sown at Naples came up
in a plentiful crop of fiction and poetry. Literary productions
must have occupied most of Boccaccio’s time until
1345, when, probably on account of his father’s remarriage,
he returned to Naples, where he is said to have
begun the<cite>Decameron</cite> under the patronage of Queen
Joanna. In 1348 the pestilence which devastated Florence
carried off his father. Boccaccio returned in 1349
to arrange family affairs, and thenceforth appears in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
quite a new light, as a trusty diplomatist, the author of
various manuals (<cite>Genealogiæ deorum gentilium</cite>,<cite>De casibus
virorum illustrium</cite>, &amp;c.) of the information most sought
for in the age, and, under Petrarch’s direction, a chief
agent in the promotion of humanistic studies. Copies
of Terence and Apuleius are extant in his handwriting.</p>

<p>One of Boccaccio’s first duties after he had settled
himself in his native city was to entertain Petrarch upon
his visit in 1350, and one of his first public missions,
performed in the following year, was to solicit him to
fix his residence at Florence and enter the service of
the Republic. Petrarch declined to entrust his repose
to so unstable a community, but his acquaintance with
Boccaccio ripened into an intimacy which might have
been compared to that of Goethe and Schiller if Boccaccio
had not gracefully and judiciously assumed a
tone of deference to the acknowledged sovereign of
contemporary literature. He is indefatigable in literary
suit and service. His piety towards Dante as well as
Petrarch leads him to transcribe for the latter the<cite>Divine
Comedy</cite>. His equal affection for Petrarch and classical
studies made him at Petrarch’s instigation entertain an
erudite but uncomfortable Greek, Leontius Pilatus, who
rendered Homer for him into very lame Latin; but still
it was Homer that he read; while the mediæval epicist
of the Trojan war, Josephus Iscanus, had known his
theme only in Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis.</p>

<p>Landor has delightfully depicted a supposed visit of
Petrarch to Boccaccio at Certaldo; one only regrets
that the conversation of the poets should turn so exclusively
on Dante. Petrarch rendered his friend one
inestimable service in dissuading him from the renunciation
of the world, into which he had been almost scared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
by the prophecies and denunciations of an expiring
monk. Boccaccio nevertheless so far profited by these
admonitions as to write nothing more to which morality
could take exception. Shortly before his end he received
one of the most honourable and appropriate commissions
with which he could have been entrusted, that of
delivering public lectures on Dante, which he had carried
down to the seventeenth canto of the<cite>Inferno</cite>, when death
overtook him on December 21, 1375.</p>

<p>The<cite>Filocopo</cite>, Boccaccio’s first and longest work of
fiction, would be thought intolerably tedious at the
present day, when one must be indeed [Greek: philokopos] to get
through it. It forms nevertheless a most important landmark
in the history of literature, for it signalises the
transition from the metrical romance to the pure novel.
Something similar had been attempted two centuries
earlier in the delightful miniature romance of mingled
prose and verse,<cite>Aucassin and Nicolette</cite>, but the example
had not been followed. About the middle of the thirteenth
century the<cite>Novellino</cite> had been compiled with
a distinct moral purpose, but its hundred tales are rather
anecdotes than novelettes. The<cite>Filocopo</cite> is founded upon
the ancient lay of Floris and Blanchefleur, which Boccaccio
has converted into prose, with a copious admixture
of new incidents, characters, and descriptions.
There is little semblance of probability in the incidents,
or accurate delineation in the characters, while the
diction, though polished, is full of what would now be
justly considered affectation and bad taste. In the fourteenth
century it was neither, but the faithful image of
the mental ferment inevitably produced by the irruption
of the classical spirit into the contracted world of the
Middle Age. Everything, indeed, was confused and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
bewildered; as the blind man suddenly restored to sight
saw men as trees, so the classical forms appeared most
strangely distorted in the mediæval atmosphere. This
ignorance, which might have excited the reprehension
of critics in Boccaccio’s age, had such then existed, is
the salvation of his book in ours: his mistaken erudition
has become charming naïveté, and the eloquence which
no longer impresses at least amuses. For its own day
the<cite>Filocopo</cite> was an epoch-making work, and traces of
its style may be met with until the displacement of the
ideal romance by the novel of manners, a development
of which the fourteenth century had no notion; although
Petronius, as yet unknown, had given an example as early
as the age of Nero. Boccaccio’s affinities are rather with
Apuleius, whom he frequently follows in the<cite>Decameron</cite>.</p>

<p>The<cite>Ameto</cite> of Boccaccio also possesses considerable
importance in literary history, being the first well-defined
modern instance of an important <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</i>, the pastoral
romance, afterwards carried to perfection by Sannazaro
and Montemayor; and also of a literary artifice, the
interweaving of several stories to compose a whole. The
stories are not very attractive, and the combination is
not very well managed, but the idea was an important
contribution to literature, and, though Longus is more
likely to find emulators than Boccaccio, the pastoral
romance still has a future before it. The tales are
supposed to record the experiences of shepherdesses
who personify the virtues, and that placed in the
mouth of Fiammetta is certainly in some measure
autobiographical.</p>

<p>More autobiographical still, and consequently nearer
to the truth of nature, is the romance called after Fiammetta,
the precursor of the modern psychological novel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
although a germ that long remained unproductive in
unkindly soil. Written, probably, about 1346, it is half-way
in style between the<cite>Filocopo</cite> and the<cite>Decameron</cite>, and
the plot is simplicity itself in comparison with the bewildering
intricacy of the former. It is merely Fiammetta’s
own detail of her unfortunate passion for a
young Tuscan, and her lamentation for his inconstancy
after his recall to his home by a stern father. The auto-biographical
element is unquestionable, but it is extremely
unlikely that Boccaccio would have accused
himself of infidelity in the person of Pamfilo. It has
been conjectured to be the work of some anonymous
writer who took him as a hero; but had this been so, the
fact would assuredly have come to light. It is more
probable that it represents, not Fiammetta’s feelings, but
his own, and that, to avoid gossip, or for artistic reasons,
he inverted the situation and the characters. Fiammetta
undoubtedly excites more interest than Pamfilo could
have done, and her sufferings appear in a more tragic
light as the penalty of her breach of conjugal fidelity.</p>

<p>It may also well be the case that Boccaccio, finding
his affection for Fiammetta on the wane, anticipated
Goethe by hastening to cleanse his bosom of the perilous
stuff while it yet retained sufficient vitality for the purposes
of art. However this may be, Fiammetta has the
merits and defects of Werther, real pathos and truth to
nature associated with the tedium hardly separable from
a long monologue, however well composed; and Boccaccio’s
style here, although a great advance on that of
the<cite>Filocopo</cite>, still suffers from ambitious rhetoric and a
superfluity of adjectives. Great part of the book, nevertheless,
attains the level of true eloquence; and Boccaccio
did much for prose when he proved it to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
an apt medium for the expression of passions heretofore
chiefly restricted to verse.</p>

<p>His fame, nevertheless, rests on his<cite>Decameron</cite>, for here
he attained the perfection which elsewhere he only indicated.
Among many lights in which this epoch-making
book may be regarded is that of an alliance between
the elegant but superfine literature of courts and the
vigorous but homely literature of the people. Nobles
and ladies, accustomed to far-fetched and ornate compositions
like the<cite>Filocopo</cite>, heard the same stories which
amused the common people, told in a style which the
uneducated too could apprehend and enjoy, but purged
of all roughness and vulgarity, and, in truth, such masterpieces
of clear, forcible prose as the greatest scholars had
till then been unable to produce. All that we know of
Boccaccio leads to the conclusion that his true mission
was to have been a poet of the people, such an one as
the unknown balladists who in simple ages have given
immortal form to popular traditions, or as the Burnses
and Heines who in artificial periods have gone back to
the fountains of popular song. Neither of these was a
possible part in the fourteenth century; but if Boccaccio
is in no respect archaic, the sap of his best work is drawn
from the soil of popular interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>Few of the stories are of Boccaccio’s invention; the
originals of some may be discovered in traditionary
folk-lore, of others in French fabliaux or classical or
Oriental writers; very many are probably true histories
in every respect but for the alteration of the names.
This is Boccaccio’s best defence against the charge of
licentiousness&mdash;he did not, like so many others, write
with the express purpose of stimulating the passions,
but reproduced the ordinary talk of hours of relaxation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
giving it the attraction of a pure and classic style. The
share of the ladies as narrators of or listeners to these
loose stories, so repugnant to ideal conceptions of the
female character, is not only explained by the manners
of the time, but has greatly contributed to the charm of
his work by tempering its licence with a refinement
best appreciated by comparison with such similar collections
as the<cite>Facetiæ</cite> of Poggio. After all, the sensuous
element, though conspicuous, is not predominant in the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, and few books contain more or finer traits
of courtesy, humanity, and generosity.</p>

<p>Prose fiction had existed before Boccaccio, and his
manner had been in some measure anticipated by some
of the tales which have found their way into the<cite>Cento
Novelle Antiche</cite>, but he was probably the first to employ
in Europe the Oriental device of setting his stories in a
frame. The structure of the<cite>Decameron</cite> is too generally
known to render it necessary to more than barely mention
its scheme as a succession of stories told by ten
persons in ten successive days, on the feigned occasion
of the retirement of a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lieta brigata</i> to a delightful
retreat from the plague which devastated Florence in
1348. Many among us will think that they ought to have
remained to aid their perishing fellow-countrymen, and,
what is more, would themselves have done so. But it
would be absurd to blame the fourteenth century for a
conception of public duty and a completeness of organisation
in public calamity which did not and could not
exist in it. Mediæval Italy produced but one Florence
Nightingale, and she was a saint. The step once taken,
the exclusion of all unpleasant tidings was its indispensable
corollary; and hence the scene of the story-telling,
with its groves and orchards, gardens and fountains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
charming company and frank converse, has ever remained
one of the green spots on which imagination
loves to rest.</p>

<p>Such an ideal of cultivated society afforded no room
for the vivacity of delineation so admirable in Chaucer’s
portraits derived from all classes; yet the prologue and
the little introductory passages to each day are, with
their feeling for landscape and poetic truth, even more
delightful than the stories themselves. If, as seems probable,
some of these were composed at Naples before
the pestilence, this lovely framework must have been
an afterthought. Of Boccaccio’s greatness as a master
of narrative, nothing need here be said, unless that his
progressiveness is even more surprising than his talent.
Ten years (1339-49) had sufficed to raise him from the
eloquent but confused and hyperbolical style of the
<cite>Filocopo</cite> to the perfection of Italian narrative. He was
now the unapproached model of later story-tellers, who
can, indeed, produce stronger effects by the employment
of stronger means, but have never been able to rival
him on his own ground of easy, unaffected simplicity.</p>

<p>Two minor works of Boccaccio, written subsequently
to the<cite>Decameron</cite>, deserve a word of notice&mdash;the<cite>Corbaccio</cite>,
a lampoon upon a widow who had jilted him,
which does him no credit morally, but evinces much
satiric force; and the<cite>Urbano</cite>, a pretty little romance
of the identification of an emperor’s abandoned son&mdash;the
genuineness of which, however, has sometimes been
doubted.</p>

<p>It was the constant destiny of Boccaccio to make
epochs&mdash;producing something absolutely or virtually
new, and tracing out the ways in which his successors,
far as they might outstrip him, were bound to walk.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
We have seen that the heroic, the pastoral, the familiar
romance owed, if not their actual birth, at least their first
considerable beginnings to him; and his activity was no
less important in the domain of narrative poetry. He
may not have been the inventor of the octave stanza,
but undoubtedly he was the first to show its supreme
fitness for narrative, and thus mark out the channel in
which the epic genius of Italy has flowed ever since.
The peculiar grace of her language, and its affluence
of rhymes, adapt it especially to this singularly elegant,
if not massive or sublime, form of versification, superior
for narrative purposes to the sinuous and digressive <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza
rima</i>, or to Italian counterfeits of the majestic blank verse
of England. It could not be expected that Boccaccio’s
attempts should at first display all the perfection his
metre is capable of receiving, he is undoubtedly lax and
diffuse. Yet all the main recommendations of the octave
are discoverable in his<cite>Teseide</cite> and<cite>Filostrato</cite>, poems especially
interesting to English readers from the imitation&mdash;frequently
translation&mdash;of them in Chaucer’s<cite>Knight’s
Tale</cite> and<cite>Troilus</cite>. The<cite>Teseide</cite> is the earlier, having
been composed shortly after Boccaccio’s return to
Florence in 1340 for the gratification of his Neapolitan
mistress; while the<cite>Filostrato</cite>, apparently composed upon
his second visit to Naples about 1347, is a disguised
satire upon her inconstancy.</p>

<p>Both from the acuteness of feeling thus engendered,
and from the rapid progress Boccaccio had in the interim
made in the poetic art, the<cite>Filostrato</cite> is the more
powerful and poetical composition; the prosperity of
Troilus’s love while returned, for example, is described
in the liveliest colours and with the truest feeling. The
<cite>Teseide</cite>, on the other hand, has the advantage of a more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
dignified and heroic story, known to the English reader,
not only from Chaucer, but from Dryden’s imitation
of the latter in his<cite>Palamon and Arcite</cite>. It also gave
the plot to Fletcher’s<cite>Two Noble Kinsmen</cite>. Boccaccio’s
source is uncertain, but is believed to have been some
Greek romance written under the later Roman Empire.
If so, he can only have been acquainted with it in a
Latin translation, now lost as well as the original. His
own poem was translated back into Greek in a miserable
Romaic version printed in 1529. For the tale of
<cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> he had Guido de Colonna’s history
of the Trojan war, itself indebted for this episode to
an ancient metrical romance.</p>

<p>The little idyllic narrative<cite>Ninfale Fiesolano</cite> is one
of the most attractive of Boccaccio’s minor writings.
It relates the breach of “Diana’s law” by one of her
nymphs, and its tragical consequences&mdash;the suicide of
the lover, and the metamorphosis, or rather the assumption
of the nymph into the waters of a river; although
the fruit of their union survives to become a hero and
found the city of Fiesole. If, as is probable, somewhat
later than the<cite>Filostrato</cite>, this pleasing little story evinces
Boccaccio’s increasing mastery of the octave couplet,
ease of narrative, and power of natural description.
Had he continued to compose in verse, he would
probably have ranked higher among Italian poets than
he does now.</p>

<p>The<cite>Amorosa Visione</cite> is an earlier and very different
work. It is written in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i>, and betrays an evident
ambition to imitate Dante, while in its turn it has not
been without influence on Petrarch’s<cite>Trionfi</cite>. Like the
latter, it testifies to the mediæval love of allegories and
stately shows, and may well have aided to inspire the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
<cite>Polifilo</cite> of Francesco Colonna. The poet is conducted
through a number of visions illustrative of the pomps
and vanities of the world, and the poem leaves off just
as, by command of his mistress, he is about to attempt
the narrow way which he should have taken at first.
Written apparently for the entertainment of a courtly
circle, and encumbered with fantastic acrostics, it reveals
little of the deep feeling of its predecessor or its successor;
but if regarded simply as the description of a
series of pageants, must be allowed the merits of fertile
invention and glowing colour. Boccaccio’s enthusiastic
praise of Dante, whom he calls the lord of all science,
and the source of everything, if there be anything,
excellent in himself, is highly honourable to him.</p>

<p>A good example of Boccaccio’s epic vein is afforded
by the prayer of Emilia to Diana in the<cite>Teseide</cite>, uttered
when Palamon and Arcite are about to fight for her
sake. For this, as for several other versions, the writer
is indebted to Miss Ellen Clerke:</p>

<p class="p1">Boccaccio thought little of his own poetry, would
have destroyed his sonnets but for the remonstrances
of Petrarch, and laments that even the incitement of
Fiammetta is unavailing to spur him on to the Temple

spared no pains to excel:</p>

<p class="p1">This judgment was unreasonably severe. It is true,
nevertheless, that Boccaccio would have gained more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
renown as a poet if the taste of his time had permitted
him to seek inspiration among the people for his verses,
as he did for his stories. How exquisite he could sometimes
be is shown by two of the sonnets translated by
Rossetti&mdash;versions, it must be owned, which surpass the
originals:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

<p class="p1"><em>Love steered my course, while yet the sun rode high,<br />

</div>

<p class="p1">Apart from the merits of his writings, Boccaccio might
rest a claim to no ordinary renown as the creator of
classic Italian prose; and even if he had found this
instrument ready to his hand, his work with it might
alone have assured him immortality. Perhaps he has a
still higher title to fame in his quality as a great originator,
achieving, indeed, no consummate work except the
<cite>Decameron</cite>, but reconnoitring the unknown world through
which the human spirit travels, and opening out new
paths on every side as he steers “bound upon beating
wing to golden bough.” As the first effective exemplar
of the heroic and pastoral romance and of the epic in
octave stanza, as the principal populariser of classical
lore, his influence will be felt to the end of time. The
books which gave him this power are, indeed, comparatively
forgotten. On the other hand, the great marvel of
his<cite>Decameron</cite> is its undying freshness. The language
is as terse and bright, the tale as readable as ever: the
commentator may exercise his research in detecting the
sources of the stories, but has little to do in explaining
obsolete diction or obsolete manners.</p>

<p>In morals and conduct, until his latter days, Boccaccio
seems to have been a perfect type of the gay and easy
class of Florentine citizens, and as remote as possible
from the wary and penurious burghers depicted in his
tale of the Pot of Basil. Apart from the fair and courteous
presence revealed in the<cite>Decameron</cite>, his principal
titles to moral esteem are his disinterested love of culture,
his enthusiasm for his master Dante, and his
obsequious yet graceful demeanour towards Petrarch,
embodying sentiments which could have found no
entrance into an ungenerous breast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>A just remark of Coventry Patmore’s on the contrast
between Dante and Shakespeare in their relation to
their respective literatures might be extended to the
Italian literature of the fourteenth century in general:
it has lofty peaks, but little elevated table-land. Dante,
Petrarch, and Boccaccio tower above their contemporaries,
who, viewed from such eminences, are almost
indiscernible. It might have been expected, nevertheless,
that the example of surpassing excellence, which
could complain of no want of popularity or recognition,
would have powerfully stimulated contemporaries
and successors, and that, as Homer gave birth to
the Cyclic poets, and Alcæus followed in the wake of
Alcman, the great Italians would have appeared as the
immediate progenitors of epicists, lyrists, and novelists
of kindred if inferior power. On the contrary, the
century from the death of Boccaccio to the appearance
of Lorenzo de’ Medici as a poet is the most barren in
Italian literary history. It produces no vernacular writer
of genius, and but few of eminent talent. It is indeed
no reproach to it to have brought forth no second
Dante, or to have failed, like all other ages, to reproduce
the inimitable perfection of Petrarch. But it
might have been anticipated that the new ways opened
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
out by Boccaccio alike in metrical epic and in prose
narrative would have been followed up, and that history
and allied branches of literature would have assumed a
classic form.</p>

<p>Little of the kind occurred, and classical study itself
ceased to produce a vivifying effect upon letters. This
may have been partly owing to excessive admiration for
the ancient writers, degenerating into pedantic imitation;
partly from the great demand for Latin translations
from the Greek, and Latin official correspondence,
encouraging Latin composition at the expense of the
vernacular; but cannot be wholly explained by any
cause peculiar to Italy, for the same phenomenon manifested
itself over Europe. Chaucer, who had carried
the poetry of England so high, had no successors;
and it would be difficult to point to a work of genius
anywhere, except the<cite>Imitatio Christi</cite>, which might have
been produced in any Christian age, and the<cite>Amadis
of Gaul</cite>, the parent of the romances of chivalry, composed
in Portugal or Spain about the beginning of
the fifteenth century. How far this is to be ascribed
to the Black Death, which, in sweeping away so much
of the existing generation, blighted so much of the
hope of the future; how far to calamities like the
Great Schism and the Jacquerie; how far to causes
unfathomable by the human intellect, will always be a
question.</p>

<p>Certain it is that, while material civilisation continued
to develop, and Leonardo Bruni, thinking only of the
cultivation of Greek, is able to say, “Letters at this time
grew mightily in Italy,” creative genius received a
check; and the standard of public virtue in most
countries fell lower than it had ever been, or has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
again. We can only note the few who in Italy, otherwise
than as classical scholars, did anything to vindicate
their age from the imputation of intellectual barrenness.
Two didactic poems with epic affinities, produced, one
shortly before, the other shortly after the death of
Boccaccio, attest more than pages of panegyric the
power with which Dante controlled the imaginations
of his countrymen. F<small>AZIO DEGLI</small> U<small>BERTI</small>, a Florentine
of whose life little is known, except that he spent
most of it in exile, and died about 1367, seems to
have thought that if Dante had appropriated heaven,
hell, and purgatory, the earth at least remained for himself.
He undertook to describe, in a number of cantos
in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i>, his perlustration of it under the escort of
a singular guide, the Latin topographer Solinus. What
Solinus is to Virgil, Uberti is to Dante; yet, though an
uninspired, he is not a contemptible writer. His geographical
epic the<cite>Dittamondo</cite> (Discourse of the World)
may be unduly prejudiced in the eyes of English readers
from Rossetti’s rendering of a canto in blank verse. It
would indeed have been a waste of time to have striven
to reproduce the original metre, yet Uberti’s tercets glide
with an ease and fluency of which the blank verse
gives no notion. The poem is not altogether destitute
of poetical spirit; one conception, that of the forlorn
Genius of Rome herself guiding the poet to her ruins, is
truly fine, but force was wanting to work it out. Otherwise
it is chiefly interesting as a repertory of the geographical
knowledge and fancies of the age. The canto
on England has been translated by Rossetti, and is
entertaining from its naïveté. Uberti must have been
an accomplished man, for he intersperses French and
Provençal verses with his Italian. He is more truly a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
poet in his lyrical than in his epic performances, if, at
least, the sonnets and canzoni which pass under his name
are really his. One, translated by Rossetti, has so much
poetical merit as to have been frequently ascribed to
Dante:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>I look at the crisp golden-threaded hair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereof, to thrall my heart, Love twists a net;</span><br />
Using at times a string of pearls for bait,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes with a single rose therein.</span><br />
I look into her eyes, which unaware,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though mine own eyes to her heart penetrate;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their splendour, that is excellently great,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discourse in this wise with my secret thought:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Woe’s me! why am I not,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hair of hers, so heavily uplaid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shed down braid by braid,</span><br />
And make myself two mirrors of her eyes<br />
Within whose light all other glory dies?</em>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Another writer of mark, nearer than Fazio to Dante both
in style and subject, is F<small>REDERICO</small> F<small>REZZI</small>, citizen and
bishop of Foligno, who died at the Council of Constance
in 1416. His<cite>Quatriregio</cite>, a moral poem describing the
author’s progress through the realms of Love, Pluto, the
Vices and Virtue, so close an imitation of Dante as to
border upon servility, is, notwithstanding, not a mean
performance. Frezzi has considerable rhetorical, if not
much poetical power, and many passages are really impressive.
The diction also is good; but the book’s chief
repute at this day is among artists, on account of the
remarkable designs adorning the edition of 1506, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
present an affinity to Botticelli’s illustrations of Dante,
and have been attributed, although on insufficient authority,
to Luca Signorelli. The poem was republished at
Foligno in 1725, with a learned commentary, of which
it was in great need. M<small>ATTEO</small> P<small>ALMIERI’S</small> poem,<cite>Città
di Vita</cite>, probably much in Frezzi’s style, arouses interest
from its having been suppressed as heretical, but its
poetical merit has never yet sufficed to allure a publisher.
“The object,” says Symonds, who read it in MS., “is
to show how free-will is innate in men.” It is founded
upon an actual vision, according lo the assertion of the
author.</p>

<p>Many other poets might be mentioned, but they are
now mere names, except S<small>ENUCCIO DEL</small> B<small>ENE</small>, chiefly
renowned as Petrarch’s friend, but himself a graceful
writer, and two of considerably later date, of one of whom
it may be truly if paradoxically said that he is chiefly
remembered for being forgotten. This is D<small>OMENICO</small>
B<small>URCHIELLO</small>, a standing example of the fickleness of
popular taste. He was a Florentine, who lived from
about 1400 to 1448, and composed numerous burlesque
sonnets <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alla coda</i> (with a tag of three lines), which retained
sufficient vitality to go through thirty editions
soon after the invention of printing, but are now inevitably
neglected, inasmuch as the Florentine slang in
which they are mainly composed has ceased to be
amusing, or even intelligible. The other poet of the
period, G<small>IUSTO DE’</small> C<small>ONTI</small>, a jurist, who lived at the court
of Sigismondo Malatesta, Prince of Rimini, and died
there about 1452, is remarkable as the chief contemporary
imitator of Petrarch, whom he followed with such
servility as greatly to impair the credit otherwise due
to him for the sweetness of his verse and the occasional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
dignity of his style. His collection of sonnets, entitled
<cite>La Bella Mano</cite>, from its perpetual reference to the
beauties of his lady’s hand, stands out at all events, as
even an inferior work might have done, from the almost
total poetical barrenness of the middle of the fifteenth
century, otherwise only relieved by the elegant sonnets
of another Petrarchist, Bonaccorso da Montemagno, and
the popular carols which gained Leonardo Giustiniani
deserved reputation.</p>

<p>More genuine poetry is to be found in the occasional
lyrics of two writers near the end of the fourteenth
century, chiefly eminent in a different species of composition,
the novelette. F<small>RANCO</small> S<small>ACCHETTI</small> and G<small>IOVANNI</small>
F<small>IORENTINO</small> are artists in words, and men of true poetic
feeling. A canzonet of Sacchetti’s (the earliest Italian
poet, says Rossetti, with whom playfulness was a characteristic),
<cite>O vaghe montanine pastorelle</cite>, was so popular
as to have been transmitted for some generations by
oral recitation, while his novelettes, until printed in the
eighteenth century, existed only in a single mutilated
manuscript. This is the conclusion of Rossetti’s translation
of this charming lyric:</p>

<p class="p1">This exquisite poem, however, rather belongs to the
late fourteenth than to the early fifteenth century, as do
other songs of equal beauty by Sacchetti and his contemporaries,
which contrast favourably with earlier Italian
lyrics by their brevity and simplicity. This is partly
attributable to their having been in general written for
music. Some of the most charming examples have been
collected in Carducci’s<cite>Studi Letterari</cite>.</p>

<p>Sacchetti and Giovanni mark the termination of the
<cite>Trecentisti</cite> period. Many writings of their contemporaries
have been printed as models of pure diction, but are otherwise
too unimportant to deserve independent notice in a
literary history<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. After the beginning of the fifteenth
century Italian prose for a while declined, mainly from
the false standard of excellence produced by exaggerated
enthusiasm for the newly recovered classics. Neglecting
the spirit, though only too attentive to the letter, of these
models, writers corrupted their diction with Latinisms.
The best books were histories, and the best of these were
written in Latin. It might have been said that to find a
really good vernacular historian we must go back to the
fourteenth century, were it not for the doubts which
beset the alleged chronicle of D<small>INO</small> C<small>OMPAGNI</small>, which
professedly details events at Florence from 1286 to 1318.
The question of its genuineness has aroused the sharpest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>controversy, which cannot be regarded as even yet
absolutely determined: the prevailing opinion, however,
seems to be that it is a fabrication dating from about
1450. It is so entertaining that one would wish it trustworthy.</p>

<p>G<small>INO</small> C<small>APPONI</small>, a leading Florentine citizen of the
latter fourteenth and earlier fifteenth century, has left
valuable memoirs of some of the transactions in which
he was engaged. The great Florentine historian of
the age, however, is G<small>IOVANNI</small> V<small>ILLANI</small>, a characteristic
embodiment of all the better qualities of his city, who,
inspired by ardent patriotism, wrote its history, including
a review of the contemporary transactions of the world,
from the Tower of Babel to 1346, on the verge of the
Black Death of 1348, by which he was himself carried
off. His work was continued by his brother Matteo and
his nephew Filippo to 1368. Villani possessed every
qualification which experience of public business could
afford, having filled several important offices, among
them those of Prior and Master of the Mint. His
language is exceedingly pure, his fidelity and impartiality
are beyond suspicion, and he is peculiarly valuable from
his preservation of financial and economical details, and
other matters affecting ordinary life. He would have
been a model historian if he had lived when the spirit of
critical inquiry was awake, and historians had learned
the delineation of character and the artistic construction
of narrative; he must, however, in this case have forfeited
the golden simplicity which renders his narrative so
delightful. His nephew Filippo, who lived far into the
fifteenth century, wrote in Latin the<cite>Lives of Illustrious
Florentines</cite>, already cited as an authority on Dante. His
memoir of Boccaccio has been frequently reprinted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>No place having hitherto occurred suitable for mention
of the<cite>Travels of Marco Polo</cite>, they, although belonging
to the thirteenth century, may find mention here. From
the purely literary point of view they are of no great
importance, but as the first book that opened the knowledge
of the East to Europeans, their significance cannot
be overrated. Mention should also be made of another
traveller, C<small>IRIACO DI</small> A<small>NCONA</small>, the first archæologist,
who, in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, set
the example of collecting inscriptions and works of
antiquity.</p>

<p>The next prose author whom it is necessary to mention,
E<small>NEA</small> S<small>ILVIO</small> P<small>ICCOLOMINI</small>, afterwards Pope Pius the
Second (1405-64), writing solely in Latin, has no place in
the literary history of the Italian language, but is perhaps
the most typical example of the fifteenth-century man
of letters, accomplished, versatile, adroit, imperfectly
restrained by principle, but inspired by a genuine zeal
for culture and humanity. No literary personage since
Petrarch had displayed such various activity, or, by his
controversial, no less than by his diplomatic ability, had
exerted an equal influence in the affairs of Church and
State. Apart from the substantial merits of his writings,
Æneas is a typical figure as indicating that the pen was
beginning to govern the world, and that literary dexterity
could make a Pope of a struggling adventurer. As an
author he has come down to our day by his Commentaries
of his own times, one of that valuable class of
histories whose authors can say, “Pars magna fui”; and
by his<cite>Euryalus and Lucretia</cite>, a romance founded on an
actual occurrence, and noteworthy as a precursor of the
modern novel.</p>

<p>In L<small>EONE</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> A<small>LBERTI</small> (1404-72) we at length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
encounter a humanist accomplished alike in the learned
and the vulgar tongue; while, like Leonardo da Vinci,
to whom he offers a strong resemblance, less remarkable
for any particular work than for the universality of his
genius. An architect and mathematician, an engineer
and the inventor of the camera obscura, he was almost
the first of the moderns to treat these subjects scientifically,
and extended his researches to painting and
sculpture. His literary celebrity, however, arises rather
from his treatise<cite>Della Famiglia</cite>, a model of practical
wisdom, couched in the clear and cheerful spirit of a
Goethe, and affording a pleasing insight into the Italian
family life of the period, as yet unspoiled by luxury.
“What he says about the beauty of the body is worthy
of a Greek, what he says about exercise might have been
written by an Englishman” (Symonds). The third
book, superior to the others in diction, has been attributed
to Agnolo Pandolfini, a distinguished Florentine
statesman of an earlier date, but Alberti’s claim to it
seems satisfactorily established. His<cite>Iciarchia</cite>, a treatise
on the ideal prince, is also a remarkable work; and his
novelette,<cite>Ippolito and Leonora</cite>, founded on a Florentine
tradition, is distinguished by pathos and simplicity.
Alberti was the natural son of a Florentine exile, and
was born at Genoa. His early years were years of hardship.
Restored to his ancestral city, he there executed
important architectural and engineering works, and subsequently
metamorphosed into a splendid temple the old
church at Rimini, which Sigismondo Malatesta dedicated
in its altered form to the memory of his mistress Isotta.
He was afterwards abbreviator of Papal briefs at Rome.
Deprived of this office, along with sixty-nine other eminent
scholars, by the Philistine but practical Pope Paul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
II., he devoted himself to architecture at Florence and
Mantua, and died at Rome in 1472.</p>

<p>The excellent V<small>ESPASIANO DA</small> B<small>ISTICCI</small> (1421-98), almost
alone among his literary contemporaries, followed a
trade, being a bookseller at Florence. He formed the
great library of the first Duke of Urbino, and has left
particulars of his zeal in the preparation of illuminated
manuscripts, and a vigorous expression of his disesteem
for printed books in comparison with them. We are
indebted to him for no fewer than 105 biographies of
contemporaries, most of whom were personally known
to him. A few, of considerable length and elaboration,
record the lives of popes, kings, and cardinals; the great
majority are brief and simple notices of scholars and
literary men, some of whom, but for Bisticci, would be
almost unknown. All are charming from their unaffected
simplicity and geniality, and the curious traits of the age
which they preserve.</p>

<p>Had G<small>IOVANNI</small> P<small>ONTANO</small> (1426-1503) written in the
vernacular, he would have won a place equal to any
contemporary’s as a poet, and a place among prose-writers
entirely his own. Though a statesman and
diplomatist, the confidant of the King of Naples, a philologist
beside, and the life and soul of the Neapolitan
Academy, he is none the less the Lucian and the Martial
of his age; the lively satirist and delineator of popular
manners in his dialogues; in his verse a genuine lyrist,
careful of form as a Greek, animated and eager as if he
had been a born Neapolitan. His prose and verse palpitate
with feeling, and he gains life at the expense of
Latinity. His historical writings, though respectable, are
of less mark; but as a popular poet and satirist, Italian
speech had an infinite loss in him. Even as it is, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
seems but one remove from a vernacular author. His
dialogues had probably much influence upon Erasmus.
Another contemporary figure is strange and enigmatical.
We know but imperfectly who F<small>RANCESCO</small> C<small>OLONNA</small>,
the author of the<cite>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</cite>, was, and
can only guess why he composed his visionary romance
in a macaronic jargon neither Latin nor Italian. The
book describes a vision in which Polifilo, after viewing
magnificent processions and going through various
adventures, ultimately obtains the hand of his lady,
Polia, who has been identified with Lucrezia Lello,
daughter of a jurisconsult at Treviso. It is barely
readable, and yet its very inarticulateness gives it a
charm which it would not have possessed if the author
had been another Boccaccio. The soul of the Renaissance
seems to have passed into it, and to be dumbly
yearning for a manifestation never found, “moving
apart in worlds not realised.” The impression is greatly
assisted by the unique illustrations to which it owes its
preciousness in artistic eyes, and whose origin is still
an unsolved problem. Their lavish fancy and skill in
rendering every variety of expression by mere outline
are apparent to all; but behind these technical qualities
lies the suggestion of a romantic and far-away world,
comparable to the Hades adumbrated in the tender farewells
on Greek sepulchral reliefs.</p>

<p>On the whole the literary harvest of the century following
the death of Petrarch was poor, and the seed dispersed
by him and Boccaccio seemed to have fallen upon barren
ground. It was not, however, entirely thus: some of
the Latin poets, such as Baptista Mantuanus, Campanus,
Augurellus, whom we have been compelled to pass
without special notice, might have won durable renown
if they had written in Italian; and though there is little
achievement in vernacular literature, several branches
of human activity are for the first time in modern
Europe brought under literary influence. The dearth
of literary genius was paralleled by an equal paucity of
statesmen and warriors of real greatness, though a Ziska
or a Sforza appears here and there. Some mysterious
cause had depressed the intellectual vitality of the age,
which, nevertheless, continued to progress in social refinement
and in opulence. Its æsthetic sensitiveness
was chiefly expressed in the rapid development of pictorial
and plastic art, and the renovation of architecture;
its literary ideal was mainly manifested by the philological
and critical apostles of the Renaissance, a remarkable
band, who must find place in another chapter.
As was to be expected under such circumstances, one
of the features of the time was the improvement of the
old universities and the formation of private societies of
scholars, which expressed Italian intellectual needs as
clearly as the foundation of the Royal Society expressed
English needs at a later elate. Two achieved special
celebrity&mdash;the Roman Academy, persecuted by Pope
Paul II. for its relapse into paganism, and the Platonic
Academy at Florence, cherished by the Medici. It fell
to the lot of the latter to solemnly decide, under the
auspices of Lorenzo de’ Medici, that the Italian language
actually was on a par with the Latin, and that a man
of wit or learning need not fear to lose caste by writing
in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE POETICAL RENAISSANCE OF THE<br />
FIFTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>In characterising the original authors, apart from critics
and commentators, whom Italy produced during the first
half of the fifteenth century, we have omitted the men
who really exerted the most important influence upon
literature. These form a group by themselves&mdash;not one
of Italian authors, for they rarely wrote in the vernacular;
scarcely one of authors at all, for they worked chiefly as
philologers. They are, however, much too important to
be passed over without notice, representing as they did
the Renaissance in its aspect as the rebirth of free
thought and inquiry, a resurrection no less momentous
than the revival of art and letters, and preparing the literary
development which they were unable to effect. Few
of them were men of extraordinary mental power, but all
were passionate for the study of antiquity, and while,
perhaps, intending to restore Latin to its rank as the sole
literary language, set forces at work which deprived it of
this primacy for ever. Even though Lorenzo de’ Medici
might apologise for writing in a language condemned by
men of good judgment, and Varchi’s schoolmaster might
punish him for reading Petrarch, when men like Alberti
took to cultivating the vernacular speech in emulation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
the Latin, it was clear that the latter had already lost its
monopoly.</p>

<p>The humanists had nevertheless in their own domain
the great advantage of being first in the field. They
could hardly advance in any direction without initiating
some movement momentous in its effect upon culture.
Emanuel Chrysoloras brought the Greek language to
Florence; his son-in-law, Filelfo, voyaged to Constantinople,
and returned with a Greek library. Poggio
Bracciolini, a most elegant Latinist and epistolographer&mdash;unfortunately
best remembered by his virulent invectives,
and by a book of facetiæ which does more credit
to his gaiety than to his morals&mdash;rendered the greatest
service by his assiduity in the collection of manuscripts.
Leonardo Bruni accomplished even more by the simple
step of making accurate translations of Plato and Aristotle,
and thus delivering Western science from bondage
to the Arabians, through whose paraphrases these
writings had hitherto been chiefly known. Lorenzo
Valla, an acute and intrepid critic and original thinker,
enthusiastic for truth in the abstract, but not generally
actuated by high principle, became the father of modern
negative criticism by his overthrow of the scandalous Papal
imposture of the Donation of Constantine. Gemistus
Pletho, though a visionary, introduced Plato to Italy, and
powerfully stimulated thought through the controversies
aroused by his writings. Flavio Biondo was the first
scientific archæologist, describing the monuments of
pagan and Christian Rome, and investigating the topography
of ancient Italy. Vittorino da Feltre showed
practically by his school at Mantua what education ought
to be, and Vespasiano da Bisticci wrote the lives of his
fellows. Even men like Filelfo, whose restless pens pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>duced
no work of real importance, kept the intellectual
life alert by their incessant activity. For the time the
age found what it needed in such men, and scholars
enjoyed the consideration awarded to poets under
Augustus, rhetoricians in the later Roman Empire,
jurists under Justinian, and the founders of religious
orders in the days of St. Dominic and St. Francis.</p>

<p>The deference shown to scholars is sufficiently attested
by the honourable offices conferred upon them, the competition
of princes and republics to obtain the most
distinguished Latinists for their secretaries, and the
throngs that attended their lectures and other public
displays, vapid and empty as these frequently appear to
us. The prevailing current of taste proved highly advantageous
in raising the standard of university education.
Bologna, in a former age the herald of Italian academic
culture, latterly in a condition of decay, revived and
asserted her supremacy, and her sister seats of learning
competed vigorously with her and each other. The
triumph of humanism seemed complete when in 1447
erudition made a Pope in the person of Nicholas V., the
founder of the Vatican Library, whose love of erudition
was such that it absolved in his eyes even Lorenzo Valla’s
exposure of pious frauds. Two great events favourable
to culture succeeded&mdash;the fall of Constantinople, which
brought a fresh flight of learned Greeks into Europe;
and the invention of printing, of which, however, Italy
did not reap the benefit until 1464. The tardiness of
so simple an invention, upon the verge of which antiquity
had continually been hovering, is one of the most
surprising facts in the history of the human mind; the
indifference with which it was at first received is hardly
less so; and the stimulus it imparted to literature long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
fell below reasonable expectation. It is remarkable, however,
that two complete versions of the Bible appeared at
Venice in 1471, and significant that no vernacular Bible
was allowed to be printed anywhere else. The general
character of the productions of the Italian press is distinctly
academical and utilitarian. Classics and classical
commentaries, theology, canon and civil law, medicine,
form the staple; imaginative vernacular literature, even
of the past, is scanty; contemporary literature might
hardly have existed so far as the early records of the
press indicate. Apart from the studies which conduced
to a livelihood, the period all over Europe was one of
intellectual barrenness. But young men of lively genius
were growing up, and one of these was in a position to
be as serviceable to modern belles-lettres as Nicholas V.
had been to the study of antiquity.</p>

<p>It rarely happens that Augustus is also Virgil; enough
if he is also Mæcenas. L<small>ORENZO DE’</small> M<small>EDICI</small> (1448-92)
united all these characters. A prince by position if not
by descent, he was not only a patron of literature, but a
highly intelligent and discriminating patron; nor only a
favourer, but himself the producer of some of the best
literature of his day. In character, in circumstances, in
the bent of his policy and the general result of his
activity, he might not unfairly be termed a miniature
Augustus; like him he confiscated the liberties of his
country as the sole alternative to anarchy, and repaid
her by prosperity and peace. All the great qualities of
Augustus were his, and few of the defects which history
chiefly censures in his prototype. Both were stronger
in the self-regarding than in the self-forgetting virtues,
but Lorenzo once rose to heroism. History records no
action of Augustus comparable to Lorenzo’s placing him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>self
in the power of the treacherous and unscrupulous
King of Naples for the sake of his country. Nor
had Lorenzo, like Augustus, ever occasion to pass the
sponge over an abortive tragedy. His compositions are
of different degrees of merit, but all are fluent and
graceful.</p>

<p>We have entered a different period from that of the
Uberti and Frezzi; the tree of poetry, so long stiff and
dry, now swells with sap, and buds with the prophecy of
a coming summer. Two distinct impulses are observable
in Lorenzo and his literary mate, Politian: in one point of
view the artistic, in the other the poetical spirit predominates.
As artists, they strove successfully to attain perfect
elegance of expression, and to improve the metrical forms
which had descended from the fourteenth century. As
poets, they seized upon the songs and catches current in
the mouths of the people, and elevated them by judicious
treatment into the region of art. This could be possible
only to men of great poetic sensitiveness. Had Lorenzo
and Politian been less refined by culture, had the one
been no scholar and the other no prince, either might
have been an Italian Burns; as it is, their work as lyric
poets is more nearly comparable to Goethe’s. They
made the popular Muse acceptable to men of breeding,
while gratifying their own tastes by work marked with
the stamp of study and erudition, and yet not beyond the
intelligence of the average educated man.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s part as the patron of art and letters is so
considerable, that his writings, important as they are,
appear almost insignificant in comparison. The most
elaborate of his poems might be classed as idylls. They
comprise the<cite>Ambra</cite>, a graceful and fanciful Ovidian
allegory on the metamorphosis of the nymph Ambra into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
a rock to escape the pursuit of a river-god;<cite>La Caccia
col Falcone</cite>, a lively description of this aristocratic sport;
and<cite>La Nencia di Barberino</cite>, no less vivid in its portraiture
of the humours of plebeian love-making. Lorenzo’s own
love poetry consists chiefly of canzoni, more remarkable
for elegance than depth of feeling, but perfectly in the
character of a man of pleasure who is also a refined
gentleman. The spirituality of Dante and his contemporaries,
the romantic passion of Petrarch, no longer suited
the age. The temple of Love, like the temple of the
Church, had been secularised; in everything men habitually
lived at a lower level. Yet this declension is compensated
in a great degree by the enhanced feeling of
reality: there can be no such controversy over Lorenzo’s
innamorata as over Beatrice and Laura. The following
is a fair example of his erotic style:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Thy beauty, gentle Violet, was born<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where for the look of Love I first was fain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my bright stream of bitter tears was rain</span><br />
That beauty to accomplish and adorn.<br />
And such desire was from compassion born,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That from the happy nook where thou wert lain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fair hand gathered thee, and not in vain,</span><br />
For by my own it willed thee to be borne.<br />
And, as to me appears, thou wouldst return<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once more to that fair hand, whence thee upon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My naked breast I have securely set:</span><br />
The naked breast that doth desire and burn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And holds thee in her heart’s place, that hath gone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dwell where thou wert late, my Violet.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">If there is more gallantry than passion in compositions
of this nature, they show at least that the lute of Love
had received a new string since the time of the troubadours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Love of a sensuous kind is a chief ingredient in
Lorenzo’s<cite>Canti Carnascialeschi</cite>, which are sometimes
highly licentious. He is accused of having composed
them with a special view of diverting the minds of the
young Florentines from politics; but it seems unnecessary
to go beyond the temptation to licence afforded by
the general relaxation of the carnival. The gay and the
serious Lorenzo were very different people, as remarked
by that acute observer Machiavelli. His epistle to his
own son Giovanni, afterwards Leo X., on his elevation
to the Cardinalate at fourteen, is a model of wisdom and
right feeling. His spiritual poems,<cite>Laudi</cite>, moreover,
frequently speak the language of true religious emotion.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s court, as is universally known, was the chosen
abode of artists and men of letters. A twin star with
Lorenzo himself, but even brighter in his literary aspect
was A<small>NGELO AMBROGINI</small> (1454-92), known as P<small>OLIZIANO</small>
from his birth at Montepulciano. Politian, the most
brilliant classical scholar of his age, was perhaps the
first professed philologist whose scholarship was entirely
divested of pedantry. With him classical studies were
a vivifying influence, pervading and adorning his literary
exercises in the vernacular, but implying no disparagement
of the latter. There is little to choose between
his Latin and his Italian poetry: the same poetic spirit
inspires both, and each is an exemplar of the charm of
a choice, yet not too ornate diction. He was accused
of writing his Latin verses “with more heat than art”;
but this is only another way of saying that while composing
them he felt as an ancient, and might very well
be taken for a poet of the Silver Age. His lyric
tragedy or opera,<cite>Orfeo</cite>, will be treated along with the
Italian drama, of which it was the first meritorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
example. His<cite>Giostra</cite>, a poem on the tournament exhibited
by Lorenzo’s brother Giuliano in 1475, and
incidentally introducing its hero’s passion for the lovely
Simonetta, remained unfinished in consequence of Giuliano’s
untimely death. It is full of beauties, and is
memorable in Italian poetry as the first example of the
thoroughly successful employment of the octave stanza.
Boccaccio had been too diffuse; but Politian exemplified
the perfect fitness of this form for the combination of
narrative poetry with an inexhaustible succession of
verbal felicities, many of which, indeed, are appropriated
from earlier poets, but all, old and new, seem fused
into a glowing whole by the passion for classic form and
sensuous beauty. But Politian and his successors did
not emulate the classical poets’ accurate delineation of
Nature. The materials of their descriptions are drawn
from storehouses to which every scholar has a key.
They bespeak reading and memory rather than actual
observation.</p>

<p>This, in Miss Ellen Clerke’s version, is Politian’s rendering
of the vision of perpetual Spring, first seen by
Homer, after him by Lucretius, and in our time by
Tennyson. Like Ariosto and Tasso, he places his enchanted
garden on earth.</p>

<p class="p1">In Politian’s own eyes and those of his contemporaries
his achievement as a poet was less important than his
labour as a classical scholar. Nor, as respected the
needs and interests of his contemporaries, was this
judgment wholly mistaken. “Knowledge in that age,”
says Symonds, “was the pearl of great price; not the
knowledge of righteousness, not the knowledge of Nature
and her laws, but the knowledge of the wonderful life
which throbbed in ancient peoples, and which might
make this old world young again.” Politian’s chief
merits as a classical scholar were to have known how to
excite a living interest in antiquity, and to have been
the first to attempt a scientific classification of MSS.
His translations from the Greek were admirable. So
long as Lorenzo presided over Florence, Politian’s lot,
though embittered by some violent literary controversies,
had been brilliant and prosperous: his patron’s death
exposed him to the general unpopularity of the supporters
of Lorenzo’s incapable successor, the French
invader stood at the doors, Savonarola’s followers began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
to assail culture in its representatives, and within little
more than two years Politian escaped the gathering
storm either by a broken heart or a voluntary death.</p>

<p>To appreciate Politian’s services in imparting literary
form to popular poetry, it will be necessary to bestow a
glance on this poetry as it existed in Tuscany in his day,
and in a measure exists still. We have previously remarked
upon the absence of national ballad poetry at a
very early period; and when at length we find traces of
popular song, little resembling<cite>Chevy Chase</cite> is to be discovered,
the staple being carols and love catches. Some
of these may be as old as the thirteenth century, and the
mass continued augmenting as one anonymous singer
after another added something sufficiently attractive to
be propagated from hamlet to hamlet, and treasured in
the memory.</p>

<p>Similar lyrical production went on over most parts
of Italy; the Sicilian songs, after the Tuscan, being
the most numerous, or at least the best preserved.
These ditties fall generally into two divisions, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rispetti</i> and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">stornelli</i>: the former consisting of four or six verses
rhyming alternately, followed by a couplet; the latter of
three lines only, the last rhyming with the first. These
soon developed into the <em>madrigal</em>, a form affected by
persons of culture and professional musicians, but the
people continued to carol as of old. Thus, spontaneous
births of the instinct for love and song, undergoing
countless modifications in passing from mouth
to mouth, until the right form has been found at last,
and sifted by the taste of generation after generation,
these little songs have formed a really beautiful
collection of verse, reflecting in their ardour, graceful
fancy and purity of sentiment, the best characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
of the race from which they sprung. How good they
are may be seen from a few of the specimens so admirably
rendered by John Addington Symonds:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">Two other leading poetical figures of the fifteenth
century, Matteo Maria Boiardo and Luigi Pulci, authors
of the<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> and the<cite>Morgante Maggiore</cite>,
will be best treated along with the writers of chivalrous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>romance in epic form. It is not quite clear how far
Pulci had a share in the poems ascribed to his elder
brother Luca (1431-70); but the latter’s verses on
Giuliano de’ Medici, his crusading epic,<cite>Ciriffo Calvaneo</cite>,
and his pastoral,<cite>Driadeo</cite>, undoubtedly owe much to
Luigi. The heroic epistles in verse which pass under
his name are no doubt by him. Another poet, G<small>IROLAMO</small>
B<small>ENIVIENI</small>, shines amid the Platonic circle of Marsilio
Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. His verses might have
given him no inconsiderable distinction if he could have
attained to lucidity of diction; but his powers of expression
are inadequate to the abstruseness of his themes.
He does best when his idealism is embodied in an
objective shape, as in the following sonnet, clearly
suggested by the first in the<cite>Vita Nuova</cite>:</p>

<p class="p1">The Italian writings of Benivieni’s friend Savonarola
are chiefly theological. Their fervour gained them great
influence at the time, but the celebrity which they still
enjoy is due rather to the fame of the writer than to
their literary qualities. Savonarola nevertheless affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
the literature of his day, partly by his war against classical
and Renaissance culture, and partly by the impulse which
he gave to the pamphlet, precursor of the newspaper press.
Cristoforo Landino’s Camaldolese Dialogues would have
been important contributions lo the national literature if
they had been written in Italian.</p>

<p>The first writer of prose who presents us with a perfect
example from which the new period may be dated
is J<small>ACOPO</small> S<small>ANNAZARO</small>, as much as Politian the nursling
of a court; to whom we are also indebted for the first
example of the pastoral romance, and the first proof
that excellent Italian prose could be written outside
Tuscany. Sannazaro, born in 1458, was a Neapolitan of
Spanish descent, as it is said, and the statement seems
to be corroborated by the peculiar independence and
dignity of character which distinguish him from the
supple literati of his time. Even Pontano, whose obligations
to the royal house of Naples were so extreme,
played an ambiguous part upon the ephemeral French
conquest of 1495. Sannazaro’s loyalty not only sustained
that brief ordeal, but when four years later the
cause of the Neapolitan dynasty was irrevocably lost, he
accompanied his fallen master to France, and spent
several years in exile. Returning to Naples, he inhabited
a beautiful villa at Mergellina, and devoted himself to
the poetry of which we shall have to speak in another
place. After witnessing the destruction of his retreat in
the French war (1528), he died in 1530 in the house of
Cassandra, Marchesa Castriota, whom he had vainly defended
against her husband’s attempt to repudiate her.
Few of his contemporaries deserve equal respect as a
man; and although as a writer but of the second rank,
it was granted to him, alike in prose and verse, to mark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
an era in literature signalising the triumph of Petrarch
and Boccaccio over the pedantry of the fifteenth century,
but at the same time the deliberate preference of
form to matter, and the discouragement of irregular
originality.</p>

<p>Sannazaro’s<cite>Arcadia</cite>, historically the most important
of his writings, is comparatively a youthful performance,
having been substantially completed by 1489, though not
published in a correct edition until 1504. It would in
any case mark an epoch as the first perfect example of
the pastoral romance, which Boccaccio had foreshadowed
in his<cite>Ameto</cite>, but which Sannazaro enriched by elements
derived from Theocritus and Virgil. His landscape and
personages are entirely classical; the shepherds contend
with each other in song precisely as in the Greek and
Latin eclogues, and no attempt is made to represent
rustic manners as they really are. The descriptions,
whether of nature or of humanity, on the other hand,
are graceful and vivid, and informed by a most poetical
sentiment; and it may be said that Sannazaro’s work
would be more esteemed at this day if it had had fewer
imitators. The style admits of but little variety, and
pastoral fiction easily became insipid in the hands of
a succession of followers who did not, like Shakespeare
in the<cite>Winter’s Tale</cite>, resort to Nature for their delineations.
Sannazaro himself is not exempt from the charge
of monotony. More serious defects, however, are those
of excessive Latinisation in the construction of sentences,
and rhetorical exaggeration, arising from his too close
adherence to the immature style of Boccaccio’s early
writings, instead of the simple elegance of the<cite>Decameron</cite>.
The resolution to achieve poetry in prose at any cost,
causes a crabbed involution and overloads the diction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
with adjectives; while there is yet enough of true feeling
to overcome even the wearisomeness of the perpetual
laments of the shepherds over the unparalleled cruelty
of their innamoratas. Sannazaro had a mistress to whose
memory he remained faithful all his life, and most of his
fictitious characters veil actual personages. When this
is understood, the romance loses its apparent artificiality;
and Settembrini’s remark is justified, “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anche oggi si sente
una dolcezza d’ affetto a leggere quel libro</i>.”</p>

<p>The main literary interest, however, of the<cite>Arcadia</cite> is
that it marks an epoch and carries the reform which
Lorenzo de’ Medici and Politian had initiated in verse
into the domain of prose. It is perhaps the sole Italian
prose composition of the fifteenth century which can be
said to wear a classic stamp; and being received with
enthusiasm and read by all, it fixed a standard which
subsequent writers were compelled to maintain. It prescribed
the rule for pastoral romance in all languages:
not only did Sidney borrow its spirit and many of its
episodes as well as its name for his own work, more,
however, of a romance and less of a pastoral than
Sannazaro’s; not only did the two great Portuguese
pastoralists, Bernardim Ribeiro and Montemayor, model
themselves upon it; but Shakespeare took from it the
name of Ophelia, and traces of it may be found, not
only in the pastoral part of Keats’s<cite>Endymion</cite>, but even
in his<cite>Hyperion</cite>.</p>

<p>By Sannazaro’s time, then, it may be said that Italian
literature was fairly despatched on the route which it
was to follow throughout the golden Cinque Cento.
Elegance, finish, polish were to be the chief aims; form
was to be esteemed at least on a par with matter; the
mediæval elements, as we find them in Dante, were to
be kept in abeyance. The classical tradition was to be
taken up, and Italy was to appear as the literary heiress
of Rome; but not to the extent of corrupting her own
language with Latinisms. Such a tacit resolution was
admirable for raising and maintaining the standard of
literary composition, but was hostile to the development
of transcendent genius.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER X<br />
<small>CHIVALRIC POETRY</small></h2>


<p>The history of the Italian chivalric epic is one of the
most interesting departments of the story of literature,
both on its own account, and because it reveals as in a
mirror the growth of the more important epic of the tale
of Troy. It arose out of a real event of the deepest
importance to Europe, but this it so disfigured by
romance and imagination as to be hardly recognisable.
Charles Martel, the deliverer of France from the Saracens,
is confounded with another and still more illustrious
Charles, whose relations with the Saracen monarchs were
usually amicable; and, by what seems to be a universal
law, this hero comes to occupy but a corner of the temple
nominally dedicated to him, and his renown is transferred
to creatures of pure imagination. As Agamemnon,
who at all events personifies the most powerful state of
primitive Greece, yields as a poetic hero to such historically
subordinate, if not absolutely fictitious personages
as Achilles and Ulysses; as the terrible Attila, the portent
of his time, shrinks in the Nibelungen Lied into the insignificant
figure of Etzel; so, in the romancer’s eye, the
real glories of Charlemagne dwindle to nothing before
the petty skirmish of Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>In all these instances, and equally so in the cycle of
Arthur, a germ of historical reality lies latent in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
human consciousness for centuries, and then suddenly
becomes prolific of a wealth of imaginative detail. There
can be no reasonable doubt that the writers of the
Homeric epics, whether few or many, stood in the same
relation to their sources as Malory and Boiardo to theirs,
inheritors of a tradition in which they reposed genuine
belief, but which at the same time they thought themselves
at liberty to embellish and diversify as they deemed
best. We should probably find the resemblance between
the development of Trojan and of Arthurian legend to
be very close, had we the same acquaintance with the
intellectual history of ancient Greece as we possess with
that of the mediæval period. Both were the result of a
great poetical revival, when the awakening spirit grasped
eagerly at the nutriment nearest to hand; and the Celtic
romancers of the twelfth century were inspired by true
Celtic yearnings for an irrevocable past, finding much
of their material in the national historian, Geoffrey of
Monmouth.</p>

<p>With the Italian romantic epic the case was somewhat
different: it was largely influenced by a single book, and
one composed with a direct polemical purpose. The
fear and hatred entertained in the tenth and eleventh
centuries for the Saracen invaders and the Danes, and
other heathens frequently confounded with them, found
expression at last in a remarkable book, the Latin
Chronicles attributed to Turpin, Archbishop of Rheims
in the eighth century, but really a fabrication of the
eleventh, in which Charlemagne and his paladins were
idealised as the vanquishers of the pagans. From the
prominent position given to Charlemagne’s imaginary
Spanish expeditions, the author is thought to have been
a Spaniard, and he owed much to that “Iliad of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
Middle Ages,” the<cite>Song of Roland</cite>, also a production
of the eleventh century. The panic passed away,
but left behind it a rich deposit of romantic fiction,
deriving a beauty unknown to former ages from
the high estimate of woman which Christianity and
Teutonic feeling had jointly contributed to the collective
human consciousness. Utilised in many French
narrative poems, this chivalric element first appeared in
Italian in the elaborate prose-romance,<cite>I Reali di Francia</cite>.
From this the step to metrical epic was easy, but the
awkwardness of the Italian poets’ first attempts seems to
indicate that it was not taken until the poetic art had
reached its period of deepest depression in the early part
of the fifteenth century, when the rude and tedious epics
<cite>Buovo di Antona</cite> (Bevis of Hampton),<cite>La Spagna</cite>,<cite>Febus</cite>,
and<cite>Queen Ancronja</cite> were probably composed.</p>

<p>Another epic of the same period, without a name,
recently discovered, is to a considerable extent the
groundwork of the<cite>Morgante Maggiore</cite><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of L<small>UIGI</small> P<small>ULCI</small>
(1432-87), a humorous poem with a serious purpose,
or, at least, unconsciously expressing some of the most
serious phenomena of the age. Its mixture of sincere
religious feeling and genuine humanity with the most
irreverent buffoonery has made it the stumbling-block
of critics and literary historians, whose interpretation
of its tendencies and estimate of its author’s character
are usually determined by their own prepossessions.
While it is impossible to deny that Morgante’s companion,
the epicurean gourmand Margutte,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is the author’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>special creation, and the object of his chief predilection
among his characters, other portions of the poem are
couched in so lofty a strain, that he has been supposed
to have had assistance from no less a philosopher than
Ficino and no less a poet than Politian. Sarcastic sallies
at the expense of the popular theology alternate with
set passages of fervent orthodoxy. To us the<cite>Morgante</cite>
appears a symbol of the intellectual anarchy then prevalent
among the most intelligent Italians, among whom
the religious sentiment survived, while its external vesture
had become mere mythology; who had neither, like
Benivieni, fallen under the influence of Savonarola, nor
were disqualified by lack of classical culture from participating
in the humanistic revival. Pulci’s opinions
are probably expressed by Astaroth, a devil introduced
to aid the paladins and talk divinity, and whose discourse
contains a marvellous foreshadowing of the discovery of
America.</p>


<p>There can, nevertheless, be no question that the frivolous
and mocking element in the<cite>Morgante</cite> is the source
of its celebrity and literary importance. It is the first
really great modern example of burlesque poetry, and
there are few literatures without traces of its influence.
In our own, it was the father of Frere’s<cite>Whistlecraft</cite>,
which was the father of<cite>Beppo</cite> and the<cite>Vision of Judgment</cite>,
the first stanza of which latter poem inverts an idea of
Pulci’s; and Byron accompanied these masterpieces by
a translation of Pulci’s first canto, upon which he himself
set a special value. It has been contended that Shakespeare
was acquainted with Pulci, and certainly Panizzi’s
portrait of the vindictive traitor Gano in the<cite>Morgante</cite>
might almost serve for one of Iago, while Orlando’s
unsuspecting magnanimity resembles Othello’s. Panizzi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
justly praises the truth and dignity of the characters of
Orlando and Rinaldo, and says of the general economy
of the poem: “Pulci was the first who wrote a long and
complicated poem which, diversified as it is by many incidents,
has a principal subject and a principal character,
on which all other parts and personages depend, without
which the poem could not subsist, and which by itself
alone forms an uninterrupted narrative. This hero and
this subject are Gano and his treachery, which brings on
the defeat of Roncesvalles.”</p>

<p>These are great merits. The principal defects are
summed up by a genial admirer, Leigh Hunt (<cite>Stories
from the Italian Poets</cite>, vol. i.), as the want of fine imagery
and natural description, and frequent triviality and prolixity.
The vulgarity objected to by the Italian critics
must exist, but is not equally offensive to a foreigner.
The poem is fully analysed by Panizzi in the first volume
of his edition of Boiardo, and its general character may
be very well caught from Byron’s translation of the
first canto. Pulci’s higher strain is ably conveyed in
the following portion of a translation of an episode by
Lady Dacre:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>And because Love not willingly excuses<br />
One who is loved and loveth not again;<br />
(For tyrannous were deemed the rule he uses,<br />
Should they who sue for pity sue in vain;<br />
What gracious lord his faithful liege refuses?)<br />
So when the gentle dame perceived the pain<br />
That well-nigh wrought to death her valiant knight,<br />
Her melting heart began his love requite.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>And from her eyes soft beamed the answering ray<br />
That Oliver’s soul-thrilling glance returns;<br />
Love in these gleamy lightnings loves to play<br />
Till but one flame two youthful bosoms burns.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
To tend his grievous wounds she comes one day,<br />
And towards him with greeting mute she turns;<br />
For on her lips her voiceless words are stayed,<br />
And her bright eyes are fain to lend their aid.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>When Oliver perceived that Forisene<br />
Accosted him with shrinking, timid grace,<br />
The pains which insupportable had been,<br />
Vanished, and to far other ills gave place:<br />
His soul is tost sweet hopes and doubts between,<br />
And you might almost 'mid these flutterings trace<br />
A dear assurance to be loved by her;<br />
For silence is Love’s best interpreter.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Not much is known of Pulci’s life except that he was
the intimate friend, correspondent, and confidential agent
of Lorenzo de’ Medici, and is said to have composed his
poem at the request of Lorenzo’s mother, whom he
celebrated after her death. The disposition of his contemporaries
to attribute the finest portions of his poem
to Ficino and Politian may indicate some failure on his
part to sustain the poetical character in his daily walk
and conversation; while the more serious passages of
his poetry, especially the noble pathos of the death of
Orlando, disclose an elevated soul. Orlando, standing
alone among his slaughtered friends on the battlefield of
Roncesvalles, is visited by the angel Gabriel, who offers
him a new army, and promises that earth and sea shall
tremble at his name. But Orlando prefers to follow
those who are gone. The<cite>Morgante</cite> was not printed till
the year after Pulci’s death. His minor works include a
poem of humble life, in imitation of Lorenzo’s<cite>Nencia</cite>,
and a series of polemical sonnets against Matteo Franco,
who was equally dyslogistic on his own part. Neither
poet need be taken very seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>The year preceding the appearance of the<cite>Morgante</cite>
(1486) saw the posthumous publication of the first part
of another poem, which, from some points of view, is entitled
to rank at the very head of romantic poetry. This
is the<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> of M<small>ATTEO</small> M<small>ARIA</small> B<small>OIARDO</small>,
Count of Scandiano. Little is known of his life except
its simple and noble outline. He was born at his family
seat of Scandiano, near Reggio, in the Modenese, about
1434. Like his successors, Ariosto and Tasso, he was a
favourite at the court of the Duke of Ferrara, his sovereign.
He celebrated Antonia Caprara in his lyrics, and
bestowed his hand upon Taddea Novellara. In his later
years he was successively governor of Modena and Reggio.
In his disposition he was most generous, and too clement
for his arduous public duties. He composed Latin poetry,
and translated several classical and other authors; and
died in 1494, on the eve of the invasion of Charles VIII.,
prophetically bewailing the consequent ruin of Italy at
the end of his unfinished<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite>, which he
is supposed to have begun about 1472. The greater part
of this poem had been published in 1486, the continuation
is said to have appeared in 1495, but the edition of
1506 is the earliest now extant.</p>

<p>Although Orlando and Rinaldo are the heroes, the story
of Boiardo’s poem is original. “<cite>Turpino istesso la nascose</cite>,”
he says. It is exceedingly graceful and ingenious.
Argalia and his sister Angelica, the children of the King
of Cathay, present themselves at Charlemagne’s court.
The former has an enchanted lance, by the virtue of
which he might have overthrown all Charles’s paladins;
but the pig-headed Saracen Feraù persists, like Monsieur
Jourdain’s servant, in thrusting tierce when he ought to
thrust quarte, and Argalia is glad to make his escape,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
leaving the lance behind him. It falls into the hands
of Astolfo, the English knight, not hitherto especially
distinguished in battle or tourney, but who at least possesses
his countrymen’s characteristic of not knowing
when they are beaten.</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Solea dir, ch’ egli era per sciagura,<br />
E tornava a cader senza paura.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">By means of this lance Astolfo performs the most
signal exploits, delivering Charles from the invasion of
Gradasso, King of Sericana, who makes war upon him to
obtain Rinaldo’s steed Bajardo, and Orlando’s sword
Durindana. Rinaldo and Orlando themselves are absent
in pursuit of Angelica, who has returned to her own
country. Angelica and Rinaldo are alternately wrought
to fondness and antipathy through the spell of enchanted
potions supplied by the poet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>. Orlando, without
obtaining any share of her affections, remains her
humble slave. All are involved in a maze of adventures,
most cunningly interwoven, replete with the endless
delight of inexhaustible invention and the surprise of
perpetual novelty. No motto for the poem could be
more appropriate than that with which Panizzi prefaces
his edition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur<br />
Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,<br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">In spite of the wild and fanciful character of the incidents,
a deep interest is excited for the principal personages,

the <em>fortisque Gyas fortisque Cloanthus</em> order, or, as the
Italian poet himself has it,</p>

<p class="p1 center"><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Avino, Avolio, Ottone, e Berlinghiero.</i></p>

<p class="p1">In this respect Boiardo has a great advantage over
Spenser; his characters are actual people, not mere
abstractions, and he is unencumbered with allegory.
As a master of poetic language he is greatly inferior.
Though both picturesque and tuneful, he is far
from rivalling the colour and music of the Englishman.
Compared to the<cite>Faerie Queene</cite> his poem is as
his own clear-chiming octave to the sonorous magnificence
of the Spenserian stanza. In general, his tone
is much more easy and familiar than Spenser’s; when
he chooses, however, his sentiment is more elevated and
his pathos more moving. Poetry has few passages at
once so nobly heroic and so exquisitely touching as the
combat between Orlando and Agricane, epitomised by
Leigh Hunt in his<cite>Stories from the Italian Poets</cite>. The
pen fell from Boiardo’s hand just as he was bringing his
errant heroes back to encounter the new invasion of the
African king Agramante, and the powerful hand that
took it up used it to delay the approaching denouement,
and superimpose a new structure upon the original
foundation. In every literary quality Ariosto excels
Boiardo, but he is a remove further from the realms of
chivalry and fairie, and</p>

'Him, who all joy contemned of sense enraptured,<br />
Now in his own despite our snare hath captured.’</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>And with their baskets, when these words were said,<br />

<p class="p1">The fastidious refinement of the Italians of the sixteenth
century for a time obscured the fame of one of
their most delightful authors. We have seen that
Boiardo was a native of the district of Reggio; we
have also seen that Reggio was among the places which,
in the opinion of no less eminent a judge than Dante,
were disqualified by their dialect from ever producing
a poet. It is no wonder, therefore, that the<cite>Orlando
Innamorato</cite> should teem with inelegances of diction,
scarcely perceptible to a foreigner, but which seemed
most flagrant in an age when priests pocketed their
breviaries for fear of contaminating their style. Two
other poets independently addressed themselves to the
task of making Boiardo presentable. Domenichi, “a
literary gentleman by trade,” did little good or harm;
he neither added nor omitted a stanza, except in the first
canto, and as he went on his emendations fell off.
Berni, a great writer in his way, of whom much must
be said when we treat of comic and familiar poetry,
inserted many stanzas of his own, and altered so many
throughout as to metamorphose the spirit no less than
the diction of the poem. Chivalry and humour are
nicely balanced throughout the original; the poet occasionally
smiles at the extravagance of his own imaginations,
but his irony never broadens into burlesque. In
Berni’s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i> the element of humour greatly preponderates,
and the elegance and grace of the adulteration
make no sufficient amends for the transposition
of a noble poem from an heroic into a familiar key.
Although his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i> was not frequently reprinted, it
attained such celebrity in literary circles that Boiardo
was almost forgotten, and the<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> commonly
passed under Berni’s name. No edition of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
original as Boiardo wrote it was published from 1544
to 1830, when Antonio Panizzi, doubtless stimulated by
the circumstance that he himself was born near Reggio,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
redeemed it from oblivion, and restored it to the place
it has ever since maintained as a star of at least the
second magnitude in the constellation of Italian epic
poetry.</p>

<p>The almost simultaneous appearance of two such
poems as the<cite>Morgante</cite> and the<cite>Orlando</cite> by two writers
of such social and intellectual distinction as Pulci and
Boiardo, indicates that the love of chivalrous fiction
must have been very rife in Italy. It is remarkable
that the Italian writers should have so rarely essayed
the easier path of prose-romance, but this they left to
the Spaniards, who on their part, excepting in ballads,
in that age rarely ventured upon poetical composition.
One only of the Italian romantic epics between Boiardo
and Ariosto deserves mention. It is the Mambriano of
F<small>RANCESCO</small> B<small>ELLO</small>, known as<cite>Il Cieco d’Adria</cite>. The
blind bard amused the court of Mantua with recitations
which he afterwards stitched together into a long poem
devoid of all pretence to epic unity. But, as he himself
observes, he thought he had done enough in bringing
all the paladins back to Paris, and rendering all the
Saracens tributary to the Emperor. His diction is often
as unshapen as his story; nevertheless, he is a real poet,
and his description of the Temple of Mars in particular
will compare not unfavourably with those of Statius,
Chaucer, and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Before parting with the predecessors of Ariosto, a
word should be said of Boiardo’s minor poems. Besides
a comedy,<cite>Timone</cite>, to be noticed hereafter, he wrote
numerous canzoni and sonnets. Of these Panizzi justly
says: “Boiardo’s poetry, although in the manner of
Petrarch, has all the marks of originality, and resembles
more the character of the predecessors of the
Bard of Laura than of his successors. His poetry was not
written to be read, but to be sung, and was submitted to
those musical as well as metrical laws by which that of
Petrarch had been governed. In his day, music was still
subject to poetry, and the inanimate instruments were
designed to support, not to drown, the human voice.”
Panizzi, therefore, seems to consider Boiardo the last of
the truly melodious lyrists of Italy; though it is just to
point out that his remark respecting the predominance
of the instrument over the voice did not become applicable
until the seventeenth century, and that he elsewhere
seems to confine the decay of Italian melody to
the two centuries immediately preceding his own time
(1830). His edition of Boiardo’s lyrics is almost inaccessible;
but he has quoted enough in his memoir of
the author to confirm his favourable judgment of their
literary qualities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>ARIOSTO AND HIS IMITATORS</small></h2>



<p>Boiardo had accomplished a great work. He had raised
the old chivalric romance to epic dignity, and shown its
capability of classic form. This, impeded by his provincial
education and the low standard of poetry prevailing
in his time, he had not himself been able to
impart. The achievement was reserved for one who has
infinitely transcended him in reputation, though it may
be questioned whether he has indeed greatly surpassed
him in any respect but style and the gift of story-telling,
and who is certainly inferior to him in sincerity and
simplicity.</p>

<p>L<small>ODOVICO</small> A<small>RIOSTO</small> was born at Reggio, near which
town Boiardo also had first seen the light, on September
8, 1474. His family was noble, and his father, who survived
his birth about twenty years, filled many important
offices. Like the fathers of Petrarch and Boccaccio, he
insisted that his son should follow the profession of the
law, which the youth renounced after five years of fruitless,
perhaps not very persevering study. His father’s
death left Ariosto at the head of a large family, for
which he had to provide out of a scanty patrimony.
He solaced his cares by classical studies, which made
him a fair Latin poet. About 1503 he entered the
service of the Cardinal of Este, brother of the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
Ferrara, and hence a member of that house whose glory
it has been to have numbered two of the most illustrious
poets of Italy in its train, and whose infelicity to have
derived more obloquy than honour from the connection.
Boiardo’s<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> had been designed for the
glorification of the house of Este, but the purpose is not
sufficiently obtrusive to spoil our pleasure in the poet’s
ideal world. Ariosto took up the thread of the narrative
where his predecessor had dropped it, and writing in the
spirit of a courtier, produced in the<cite>Orlando Furioso</cite> a
sequel related to Boiardo’s poem much as Virgil’s national
epic on the wanderings of Æneas is related to Homer’s
artless tale of the wanderings of Ulysses.</p>

<p>In so far as Ariosto’s objects were poetical fame and
the honour of his native country they were attained
to the full; but his toil was almost vain as respected
recompense from the princes for whose sake he had
blemished his poem. The Cardinal, a coarse, unscrupulous
man, fitter for a soldier than an ecclesiastic,
was apparently unable to discern any connection between
Ruggiero’s hippogriff and the glories of his
descendants, and upon the publication of the<cite>Orlando</cite>
in 1510, asked the poet quite simply “where he had
been for all that rot?” He is stated, however, to
have presented Ariosto with a golden chain, rather
for the ornament of his person than the relief of his
necessities, as he could not venture to turn it into
money. Ariosto further incurred his Eminence’s displeasure
by hesitating to accompany him on a mission
to Hungary, and found it advisable to exchange his
service for the Duke’s. The Duke, a prince lavish in
shows, economical in salaries, thought the poet abundantly
rewarded by the governorship of the Garfagnana,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
which it was necessary to confer upon somebody. The
Garfagnana was a wild district overrun with poetical
banditti, readers and admirers of their governor’s epic.
Here Ariosto gained much honour, but little emolument.</p>

<p>His experience of his patrons generally justified his
favourite motto,<cite>Pro bono malum</cite>. Even the munificent
Leo X. did nothing for him but kiss him on both cheeks,
and remit half the fees upon the brief that assured his
copyrights, his particular friend Cardinal Bibbiena pocketing
the other. His sole real benefactor was the Marquis
del Vasto, husband of the lady whom we shall find
celebrated by Luigi Tansillo, who settled an annuity of a
hundred ducats upon him. Even this was consideration
for value to be received, the Marquis, himself a poet,
being properly impressed by the<cite>Vixere fortes ante
Agamemnona</cite> maxim. Ariosto acquitted himself of his
obligation like a man, comparing his patron to Cæsar,
Nestor, Achilles, Nireus, and Ladas. Great as was the
renown which his<cite>Orlando</cite> procured for him in his lifetime,
its profits were not such as to render him independent
of patronage; yet, after all, he was able to boast that
the modest house which he built for himself, and where
he died in 1533, was paid for by his own money.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is
kept to this day by the municipality of Ferrara; and
Ariosto’s manuscripts, evincing his indefatigable care
in the revision of his poem, are preserved in the public
library.</p>

<p>The chief literary occupations of his latter years had
been the composition of comedies, the superintendence
of theatrical performances for the entertainment of the
Duke, and the incessant revision of the<cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>enlarged from forty to forty-six cantos. The last edition
published under his own inspection appeared in 1532,
and was not regarded by him as definitive. He also
began a continuation, intended to narrate the death of
Ruggiero by the treachery of Gano, of which only five
cantos were written.</p>

<p>So great is the variety of the<cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>, that it
appears difficult at first to discover a clue to a main
action among its thronging and complicated adventures.
Ginguené and Panizzi, however, have shown that one
exists, and that this is the union of Ruggiero and Bradamante,
the fabulous ancestors of the house of Este. All
the poet’s skill is exerted to keep them apart, that he may
bring them together at last. Orlando, Rinaldo, Angelica,
the chief personages of the<cite>Innamorato</cite>, have become
subordinate characters; and, notwithstanding the title
of the poem, Orlando’s madness is but an episode. The
unfortunate consequence is the transfer of the main interest
from personages whom Boiardo had made highly
attractive, to Ruggiero and Bradamante, less impressive
in the hands of Ariosto, whose forte is rather in depicting
tender or humorous than heroic character. It would
not be just to say that this occasions the chief disadvantage
of the poem in comparison with the<cite>Innamorato</cite>,
the loss of the elder poet’s delightful naïveté. Rather
the change of plan and the falling off in simplicity
spring from the same root, the taste and character of the
author.</p>

<p>Ariosto was more of a courtier than a knight, and
thought more of the house of Este than of the paladins
of Charlemagne. He wrought upon Boiardo in the
spirit of Dryden adapting Chaucer; while his predecessor,
though himself courtly, may rather be likened to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
William Morris. Boiardo, though also purposing the
panegyric of the house of Este, sings for the delight of
singing, and introduces no incongruous fifteenth-century
figures into his romantic pageant. Ariosto mars his epic
by contemporary allusions, as Spenser and Tennyson
marred theirs by far-fetched allegory. It must be remembered,
in justice to him, that his perpetual adulation
of the court of Ferrara seemed less extravagant then than
now. To us the importance attached to a family which
would be forgotten if Ariosto and Tasso had not swelled
its retinue, and if Lucrezia Borgia had not married into
it, borders on the absurd. It seems preposterous that
hosts should be equipped, and giants and dragons and
enchanters set in motion, and paladins despatched on
errands to the moon, that Ariosto may compliment a
cardinal whose want of culture rather than his penetration
led him to rate these compliments at their worth.
But in Ariosto’s day that court was a bright and dazzling
reality, and almost every member of his immediate circle
depended upon it for his bread.</p>

<p>If we can forget his servility, or persuade ourselves
to deem it loyalty, we shall find little to censure in
Ariosto. Shelley’s assertion that he is only sometimes
a poet implies a narrow conception of the nature
of poetry. Rather may it be said that he is always a
poet, always fanciful, always musical, always elevated,
though not always to a very great altitude, above the
level of the choicest prose. It is true that he has
nothing of the seer in his composition, that his perfect
technical mastery is rarely either exalted or disturbed by
any gleam of the light that never was on sea or land,
that his poem is destitute of moral or patriotic purpose,
and that his standard in all things is that of his age.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
This merely proves that he is not in the rank of
supremely great poets&mdash;a position which he would not
have claimed for himself; nor have his countrymen
paralleled him with Dante. He is hardly to be called
Homeric, though endowed with the Homeric rapidity,
directness, conciseness, and, except when he voluntarily
turns to humour and burlesque, much of the
Homeric nobility.</p>

<p>Perhaps the nearest literary analogy to the<cite>Orlando
Furioso</cite> in another language is the<cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of
Ovid. In both poems appear the same perspicuity and
facility of narration, the same sweetness of versification,
the same art of interweaving episodes into a whole.
Ariosto’s vigour and directness, nevertheless, are wanting
to Ovid, and the palm of invention and of the delineation
of character undoubtedly belongs to him, for Ovid was
forbidden to introduce a new incident, or vary any of
the personages afforded by his mythological repertory.
The fact that the<cite>Orlando</cite> is not, like the<cite>Jerusalem</cite>, a
new<cite>Æneid</cite>, but a new<cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, entirely justifies
the introduction of such burlesque satire as the abode of
Discord among the monks, or such delightful extravagance
as Astolfo’s flight to the moon in quest of Orlando’s
brains, resulting in the recovery of no inconsiderable
portion of his own. Such episodes are, indeed, the most
characteristic passages of the<cite>Furioso</cite>; yet in others, such
as the siege of Paris and the madness of Orlando, Ariosto
shows himself capable of rising to epical dignity, which
he could have assumed more frequently if it had entered
into his plan. This rather required the gifts of the
painter, whether of natural scenery or of human emotion,
which he possessed in the most eminent degree; and of
the ironic but kindly observer of human life, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
exhibited so fully that even his descriptions are less
popular and admired than the reflective and moralising
introductions to his cantos. Never was such wildness of
imagination ballasted with such solid good sense. Yet,
when all is said, his most distinctive merit remains his
unsurpassed talent of exposition, his unfaltering flow of
energetic, perspicuous, melodious narrative; excellence
apparently spontaneous and unstudied, but in truth due
to the strenuous revision of one who judged himself
severely, and deemed with Michael Angelo that trifles
made perfection, and perfection was no trifle. Mr.
Courthope, in an admirable parallel, has pointed out his
great superiority as a narrator to his disciple Spenser,
whose pictures, nevertheless, glow with deeper and softer
tints, and whose voluminous melody tills the ear more
perfectly than Ariosto’s ringing stanza.</p>

<p>The controversy whether Ariosto or Tasso’s poem is
the greater epic, as it was one of the most obstinately interminable
ever raised by academic pedantry, is also one
of the idlest. They belong to different departments of
art; it would be as reasonable to compare a picture
with a statue. The question, nevertheless, which of the
men was the greater poet, does admit of profitable discussion,
though it may be difficult to establish any but
a subjective criterion. If endowment with the poetical
temperament is to be taken as the test, the palm certainly
belongs to Tasso, whose actions, thoughts, and
misfortunes are invariably those of a poet, and whose
inward music is constantly finding expression in lyrical
verse. Ariosto’s comparatively few lyrics generally wear
a less spontaneous aspect than Tasso’s; the incidents of
his life rather bespeak the man of affairs than the man
of books; and if his<cite>Orlando</cite> had perished, we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
hardly have surmised how great a poet had been lost
in him.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the palm should be bestowed
for mastery of art, it seems rather due to Ariosto,
who handles his theme with more vigour, and has it
more thoroughly under control. He is not obliged, like
Tasso, to embellish his poem with episodes which, by
their superior attractiveness, almost eclipse the main
action: the few passages of the kind in the<cite>Orlando</cite> are
strictly subordinate, and not among its principal ornaments.
The chief artistic blots upon his poem could
not well have been avoided. So completely, though
unjustly, has he overshadowed his predecessor Boiardo,
that we are apt to forget that his work is an example,
unique in literature, of the successful continuation of
another’s. The adulation of the house of Este was an
inheritance from his precursor; it is only to be regretted
that, contrary to the example of Boiardo and the
subsequent practice of Tasso, he should have given it
disproportionate prominence. The incurable defect of
the action of the<cite>Furioso</cite> is also a legacy from the
<cite>Innamorato</cite>. Ruggiero, the real hero of Ariosto’s part of
the poem, wins the hand of Bradamante, and becomes
the ancestor of the house of Este, by apostasy. The
poem finds him a pagan, and leaves him a Christian.
All that ingenuity can effect is employed to extenuate his
desertion; nevertheless, the sympathies of every reader
must be with the Saracen Rodomonte when he appears
in the last canto to tax Ruggiero with his change of
sides, and necessarily (for otherwise what would have
become of the house of Este?) is slain for his loyalty, to
the scandal of poetical justice.</p>

<p>That Ariosto, apart from his boundless invention and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
command of language and narrative, was a true poet, is
shown by the extreme beauty of the majority of the introductions
to his cantos, where he appears even more
at home than in the descriptions of the deeds of prowess
of which he was at bottom so sceptical. Another strong
point is the number, vividness, and originality of his
similes, not in general copied from ancient poets, but
peculiar to himself, and perfectly descriptive of the
object designed to be illustrated. One of the most
apparently characteristic similes of a great master of
quaint comparison, the late Coventry Patmore, is borrowed
from him.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The sense of Ariosto is easily represented in English,
but it is another matter to reproduce his felicity of phrase.
The following stanzas in Miss Ellen Clerke’s version are
from the description of Angelica’s flight from Rinaldo:</p>

<p class="p1">The morality of the<cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>, some licentious
episodes excepted which stand quite apart from the main
action, may be considered good, being that of a refined
and courtly circle where lofty virtues were cordially
recognised in theory, however they might fail to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
exemplified in practice. Ariosto does not, like Tasso,
convey the impression of a man above his time, and only
depressed to its level by unpropitious circumstances.
He is the child of his age, at the summit of its average
elevation, but not transcending this. Yet it would have
been well for Italy if her princes and statesmen had
generally acted upon those ideas of honour and loyalty
which they found and doubtless admired in their favourite
poet. Such precepts as the following, even though enforced
by the teacher’s example, were in their view much
too good for ordinary practice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Bundle with cord is not so bound, I ween,<br />
Or plank to plank so riveted by nail,<br />
As knightly troth that once hath plighted been,<br />
Doth with the true and loyal soul prevail.<br />
Nor is Fidelity depicted seen,<br />
Save robed from head to foot in candid veil,<br />
Visage enveloping and frame and limb,<br />
Since but one stain would make her wholly dim.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>Pure must she ever be, and free from spot,<br />
If to one only or to thousands plighted;<br />
Nor less if vowed in woodland wild or grot<br />
Far from men’s ways and dwellings disunited,<br />
Than where the judge doth duly law allot,<br />
And deeds are sealed, and testimonies cited.<br />
Nor oath she needs, or like appeal to Heaven;<br />
Enough the solemn word once gravely given.</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>His pledge chivalric, and the faith he gave,<br />
Zerbin in every circumstance defended;<br />
But ne’er did prove himself their duteous slave<br />
More than when now disconsolate he wended<br />
With this detested hag, whom like the grave<br />
His soul abhorred: by plague or death attended,<br />

Bound him to that objectionable dame.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p class="p1">To appreciate Zerbino’s fidelity to his word, it must
be known that, having been vanquished in a joust, he
has been compelled to vow to escort a hideous old
woman of singular depravity, and to maintain her beauty
and virtue against all comers, with the prospect of being
killed in her service. A more comic situation will hardly
be found in any of the romances.</p>

<p>Ariosto’s comedies must be considered along with the
Italian drama in general. The most important of his
minor poetical works are the Satires, rather in the vein
of Horace than of Juvenal, and, in truth, hardly satires at
all in any proper sense of the term. They are good
metrical talk on light subjects, elegant, chatty, and discursive.
His own disappointments are alluded to very
good-humouredly. His lyrical pieces are not remarkable,
except one impressive sonnet, in which he appears
to express compunction for the irregularities of his
life:</p>

<p>Late in life the poet married; whether he also reformed
seems doubtful. His amours, however, were unaccom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>panied
by tragedy or scandal. In fact, this most wildly
imaginative of the Italian poets seems to have had less
than most poets of the poetic temperament, and the
amiability for which he is universally praised was not
accompanied by any remarkable acuteness of feeling.
His virtues were those of an excellent man of the world;
he was liberal, courteous, sensible, just, and sincere.</p>

<p>The success of the<cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>, which Bernardo
Tasso, writing in 1559, affirms to be better known and
more talked of than Homer, naturally produced the same
effect as the popularity of Scott and Byron produced in
England&mdash;“All could raise the flower, for all had got the
seed.” The two most important of these imitations, the
<cite>Girone il Cortese</cite> of Luigi Alamanni and the<cite>Amadigi</cite> of
Bernardo Tasso&mdash;both good poets, to be mentioned again
in other departments of literature&mdash;resemble Pygmalion’s
image before the interposition of Venus; all the constituents
of a fine poem are there, but the breath of life
is wanting. “The<cite>Girone</cite>,” says Ginguené, “is a very
dignified, very rational, and generally well-written poem,
but cold and consequently somewhat tiresome.” If
there is more warmth in the<cite>Amadigi</cite>, there is also
more loquacity, and the power of the author, an excellent
writer on a small scale, is quite inadequate to sustain
continuous interest through a hundred cantos. The
comparison which he necessarily courts with the old
romance of Vasco Lobeira, the best work of its class, is
always unfavourable to him. His copious employment
of elfin machinery gave him opportunities of which
he failed to avail himself. The best of him as an epic
writer is his gift of brilliant description. The younger
Tasso’s<cite>Rinaldo</cite> is a very extraordinary production for a
youth of eighteen, but the impulse towards the chival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>rous
epic was exhausted by his time, and he wisely
found another way of rivalling Ariosto. The<cite>Orlandino</cite>
and the<cite>Ricciardetto</cite> belong rather to the class of the
mock heroic, to be treated hereafter. The names of a
few of the most remarkable <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bona-fide</i> attempts at chivalric
poetry must suffice: the<cite>Guerino il Meschino</cite> of Tullia
d’Aragona, the<cite>Ogier the Dane</cite> of Cassiodoro Narni,
the<cite>Death of Ruggiero</cite> of Giambatista Pescatore, the
<cite>Triumphs of Charlemagne</cite> of Francesco de’ Lodovici, the
<cite>First Exploits of Orlando</cite> of Lodovico Dolce, and the
<cite>Angelica Innamorata</cite> of Vincenzo Brusantini.</p>

<p>Apart from the poems of the chivalric cycles, Italy
witnessed but few attempts at epic in the first half
of the sixteenth century. Of the author of one of
these, however, it might be said,<cite>Magnis excidit ausis</cite>.
G<small>IOVANNI</small> G<small>IORGIO</small> T<small>RISSINO</small> was born of a noble
family at Vicenza in 1478. He repaired the defects
of a neglected education with singular industry, and
endeared himself to the two Medici Popes, Leo and
Clement, who entrusted him with important diplomatic
missions. His most successful poetical work, the tragedy
of<cite>Sophonisba</cite> (1515), brought him great fame, and
actually does mark an era in the history of the drama.
He wrote much on grammar, but could effect only one
reform, the distinction between <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> and <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>.
After his retirement from diplomacy Trissino lived many
years among his fellow-citizens, wealthy and honoured;
but his later years were embittered by a painful and
disastrous lawsuit with his son by his first marriage.
He died in 1549.</p>

<p>Trissino had commenced in 1525 the composition
of his epic,<cite>The Deliverance of Italy from the Goths</cite>,
which was published in 1547 and 1548. It has some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
literary interest as the first attempt to write Italian
epic poetry in blank verse, but its great misfortune is
to be in verse of any kind. The diction is good, the
exposition simple and clear; if turned into prose it
would make a pleasant story for youth, something like
Fénelon’s<cite>Telemachus</cite>. But how a man of Trissino’s cultivation
could have persuaded himself that a mere metrical
form, and this neither artful nor tuneful, could turn
prose into poetry, is indeed difficult to understand. The
disyllabic termination of the lines&mdash;almost inevitable in
Italian&mdash;is not conducive to metrical majesty at the best;
and Trissino seems to have had no idea of cadence or
variety, and to have been content if he could scan his
lines upon his fingers. There is no inspiration, and no
pretence to inspiration, from exordium to peroration of
his sober epic; his Pegasus is not only a pack-horse, but
a pack-horse without bells.</p>

<p>In truth, the displacement of the Goths, making room
for the Pope, the Lombard and the Byzantine Exarch,
was no deliverance for Italy, but her great misfortune.
A poet, however, is not obliged like a historian to
distinguish nicely between Theodoric and Alaric; and
Trissino, with all his pedantry, might have ranked as
a bard if he could have felt as a patriot; if he could
have depicted the Italy of the Goths as the prototype of
the Italy of his own age, rent amid French and Spaniards
and Germans. Whether he conceived the idea or not, he
could not or dared not give it utterance. He nevertheless
energetically denounced the abuses of the Papacy by a
prophecy put into the mouth of an angel.</p>

<p>The history of chivalric poetry is especially interesting,
as it in all probability exactly repeats that of the
Homeric epic. While the great events, the siege of Troy
and the Saracen invasion of France, are being really
enacted, we have no poetry at all. After two or three
centuries ballads appear, disfiguring genuine history,
and shifting its centre of gravity to incidents unimportant
in themselves, but susceptible of poetical treatment.
After two or three more, poets arise who
embellish these romances, bestow poetical form upon
them, and work them into consistent wholes. Had Italy
been no further advanced than Greece at the corresponding
epoch, the poems of Boiardo and Ariosto would have
braved two centuries of oral recitation, and come much
corrupted and interpolated into the hands of some
Aristarchus who would have given them their final form.
The invention of printing suppressed this ultimate stage
of development, but encouraged the growth of imitators,
whom it preserved from annihilation, while unable to
preserve them from oblivion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>MACHIAVELLI AND GUICCIARDINI</small></h2>


<p>We have now traversed nearly three centuries of Italian
literature without encountering one really great prose-writer,
Boccaccio only excepted. Unquestionably the
development of Italian prose was retarded by the cultivation
of Latin, which deprived it of ornaments in
Petrarch, Pontano, and Æneas Sylvius&mdash;to say nothing
of the buried talent which the example of such writers
would have called into activity. With every allowance
on these accounts, it is still remarkable how generally
the path of the historian of early Italian literature
lies amid the flowers of poetry and fiction. But the
time had now come when, as in Greece, the national
genius was about to assert itself in prose, and, also as in
Greece, the movement was heralded by historians. After
a long interval, due to the exclusive cultivation of ancient
models, the Italian Herodotus, Giovanni Villani, was to
be followed by two men who might dispute the character
of the Italian Thucydides, who at all events belonged to
that invaluable class of historians who, like Thucydides,
in the events of which they are the narrators
and the judges. This advantage was possessed in an
eminent degree by F<small>RANCESCO</small> G<small>UICCIARDINI</small>, the historian
of contemporary times; and though N<small>ICCOLÓ</small>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
M<small>ACHIAVELLI</small> did not write his principal work as a
contemporary, his knowledge of the Florentine constitution
was so intimate as almost to invest him with
the authority of an eye-witness of the Florentine
revolutions of the past.</p>

<p>Niccolò Machiavelli, the first Italian and almost the
first modern to display eminent genius as an historical
and political writer, was born at Florence, May 3, 1469.
His family had been illustrious for public services; his
father, whom he lost at sixteen, was a jurist; his mother
was a poetess. Little is known of his life until we find
him in 1494 secretary to Marcello Virgilio, a learned man
who four years afterwards became head of the chancery
of the Republic, a post somewhat resembling Milton’s
Latin Secretaryship under the Commonwealth, but allowing
more active participation in the business of diplomacy.
Machiavelli rose along with his patron, and in 1500 was
entrusted with a mission to France. In the following
year he had a more arduous part to play as envoy to
Cæsar Borgia, then consolidating his power in the
Romagna, but for the moment pressed with great difficulties.
Machiavelli’s reports of his mission have been
preserved, and attest the impression made upon him
by Cæsar’s supremacy in ability and villainy, which continued
to fascinate him when years afterwards he composed
his manual of political statecraft.</p>

<p>Judged in the sinister light which his writings
have seemed to throw back upon his actions, he has
been accused of having counselled and devised the
coup by which Cæsar destroyed his treacherous condottieri
at Sinigaglia, as if the Borgia needed any
tuition for an exploit of this nature. He is also
censured for recording it without disapproval; but if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
Cæsar had never done anything worse than rid the
Romagna of its vermin, history would not be severe
with him. Two years later, employed upon a mission
to Rome, he beheld Cæsar’s fall, and the elevation of
Pope Julius, whom he accompanied on yet another
mission to the conquest of Bologna. He was also
despatched about this time on embassies to Germany
and France, and his observations on the circumstances
and characteristics of both nations exhibit great sagacity.
Soon afterwards the affairs of the Republic became
troubled, hemmed in as she was between the
transalpine powers and the Pope and the exiled Medici.
Machiavelli was actively engaged in organising her
military resources, but his efforts were fruitless. The
restoration of the Medici was effected in September 1512.
Machiavelli lost his employments, and soon afterwards,
upon suspicion of participation in a conspiracy, was
thrown into prison, tortured, and owed his deliverance
to an amnesty granted as an act of grace by the
Medicean Pope Leo upon his election in 1513.</p>

<p>He retired to a small estate, where, as he tells us in a
most interesting letter which has reached our times, he
consoled himself with the study of the ancients, familiar
intercourse with his rustic neighbours, and the composition
of his<cite>Prince</cite>. The chief purpose of this famous work
certainly was not to recommend himself to the Medici, but
he would willingly have made it subservient to that end.
They neglected him, however, until 1519, when Cardinal
Medici, afterwards Pope Clement VII., called upon him
for a memoir on the best method of administering the
Florentine government, in which Machiavelli showed
much dexterity in reconciling the interests of the house
of Medici with the interests of his country. His advice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
was not followed; but the Cardinal commissioned him
to write the history of Florence. He had previously
employed his leisure in the production of his memorable
discourses on Livy, his comedy the<cite>Mandragola</cite>, and his
life of Castruccio Castracani. In 1527 he was employed
in fortifying Florence against an apprehended attack of
the Imperial army, which fell upon Rome, and he afterwards
accompanied the forces sent to make a show of
delivering the Pope. During his absence the Medicean
government was overthrown, an event highly agreeable
to his secret wishes; but his compliances had rendered
him odious to the patriotic party, and he returned to his
native city to find himself the object of general aversion
and suspicion. His mortification probably hastened his
death, which took place on June 21, 1527.</p>

<p>Of all Machiavelli’s writings the<cite>Prince</cite> is the most
famous, and deservedly, for it is the most characteristic.
Few subjects of literary discussion have occasioned
more controversy than the purpose of this celebrated
book. Some have beheld in it a manual for tyrants,
like the memoirs of Tiberius, so diligently perused by
Domitian; others have regarded it as a refined irony
upon tyranny, on the sarcastic plan of Swift’s Directions
to Servants, if so humble an analogy be permissible.
From various points of view it might alternately pass for
either, but its purpose is accurately conveyed by neither
interpretation. Machiavelli was a sincere though too
supple a republican, and by no means desired the universal
prevalence of tyranny throughout Italy. If he
had written with the sole view of ingratiating himself
with the Medici&mdash;probably in fact a subordinate motive
with him, and the rather as there actually was a project
for investing Giuliano de’ Medici with the sovereignty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
the Romagna, the theatre of Cæsar Borgia’s exploits&mdash;he
would have been much more earnest in pressing it upon
their attention. If, on the other hand, satire had been
his chief object, this would have been more mordant and
poignant; his power of contemptuous irony is only revealed
in the short chapter on the Papal monarchy. His
aim probably was to show how to build up a principality
capable of expelling the foreigner and restoring
the independence of Italy. But this intention could not
be safely expressed, and hence his work seems repulsive,
because the reason of state which he propounds
as an apology for infringing the moral code appears not
patriotic, but purely selfish.</p>

<p>In our day we have seen Italian independence won by
appeals to the patriotism of the nation at large. This was
impossible in Machiavelli’s time; nor, had it been otherwise,
would his lips have been touched with the live coal
of a Mazzini. He could only speak as a politician to politicians,
and addressing himself as it were to a body of
scientific experts, he designedly excludes all considerations
of morality. His treatise appears antiquated in our
day, when the national conscience is as easily manipulated
as the conscience of the individual; in oligarchical ages
it passed not unreasonably for a perfect manual of statecraft,
and exercised great influence upon the statesmen
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Frederick
the Great assailed it vehemently in his youth, but lived
to compliment it by what has been described as the
sincerest form of flattery. In Frederick’s century, when
public affairs actually were in the hands of a few able
rulers, it was worth attacking and defending; in the
present democratic age, when a statesman who squared
his conduct by its maxims would soon find himself the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
object of popular odium, its interest, except as regards
its weighty plea for a popular army, is mainly historical
and psychological. There is an intimate connection
between the<cite>Prince</cite> and the seven books on the<cite>Art of
War</cite>, written about 1520. In the<cite>Prince</cite> Machiavelli
insists particularly upon the part which the habit of
relying upon treacherous and mutinous mercenaries,
and the consequent decay of public spirit among the
citizens, had had in bringing about the ruin of the
Italian states. In the<cite>Art of War</cite> he shows how the
citizen army he recommends is to be organised and led
in battles and sieges. His experience of military affairs
as an eye-witness, as well as an administrator, had been
considerable, and he is by no means to be slighted as a
tactical writer; but the military art was on the eve of
great changes, which rendered much of his wisdom
obsolete.</p>

<p>The<cite>Discourses on Livy’s Decades</cite> occupy a middle
position between political and historical science. They
are entirely grounded on the study of Livy; but their
main importance consists not in the commentary upon
the transactions Livy has related, but in the application
of these to the general principles of politics and to the
circumstances of the writer’s own country. They may
be defined as in some sort the<cite>Prince</cite> rewritten on a
larger scale, and copiously illustrated by historical examples;
but the effect is much more pleasing. In the
other book Machiavelli appears as the mere scientific
analyst of politics, and his real purpose might be
reasonably questioned; but the<cite>Discourses</cite> leave no
doubt of his genuine patriotism and of his preference
of morality to obliquity, except where, as it seems to
him, the interest of the state interferes. The problem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
of the permissibility of an act reprehensible in the abstract,
but required by the safety of the stale&mdash;as, for
example, Mohammed Ali’s massacre of the Mamelukes&mdash;is
a very difficult one, and Machiavelli cannot be fairly
judged from the standpoint of the nineteenth century.
He had not seen the trial and failure of his ideal
prince on a colossal scale in the person of Napoleon.
It was a cardinal error of his to deny a capacity
of improvement to human nature and to assume that
mankind would be essentially the same in all ages.
We see, on the contrary, that the general standard of
righteousness has been greatly raised since his time;
and that, even if this were not so, the conditions of
modern society are adverse to Machiavellian policy: to
import this perception, however, into the criticism of his
work would be but to reverse his own mistake. Many
other criticisms might be addressed to him: he did not,
for example, foresee that another set of patriots, from
their own point of view, might arise, whose conception
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i> in polity would be entirely different
from his own; and that within a few years his maxims
might serve as an arsenal for the Jesuits, whose objects
would have been his utter abomination. With all his
faults and oversights, nothing can deprive Machiavelli
of the glory of having been the modern Aristotle in
politics, the first, or at least the first considerable writer
who derived a practical philosophy from history, and
exalted statecraft into science.</p>

<p>Machiavelli’s<cite>History of Florence</cite> is not, like his<cite>Discourses</cite>,
a work of profound thought, nor is it authoritative
in any respect. It rather exhibits him as the
elegant and accomplished man of letters, and is perhaps
the first successful restoration of the classical style of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
history to a European vernacular. His great contemporary
Guicciardini had indeed anticipated him with a
fragment on the same subject, but this long remained
unpublished, and it is not likely that Machiavelli ever
saw it. Machiavelli has not delved deep for materials;
much of the early part of his history is taken almost
literally from Flavio Biondo and other predecessors.
He has sometimes departed unjustifiably from strict
matter of fact, not by invention or serious misrepresentation,
but by accentuating and slightly modifying actual
incidents to give them the particular colour he desires.
In the main, however, his work is a faithful as well as
an animated picture of the public life of a community
in its characteristics more nearly akin to the ancient
commonwealth of Athens than any the earth has seen
since this disappeared from her face. The quality which
will preserve even a bad history, and without which a
good one will only live as a book of reference, is never
absent from Machiavelli’s&mdash;he entertains while he instructs.
His work, which was composed after 1520 by
order of Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici, is divided into eight
books, and extends from the beginning of Florentine
history to the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici in 1492.
The intimate connection of Florence with the general
course of Italian politics leads to frequent digressions
and copious notices of neighbouring states. Another
historical work of Machiavelli’s, the Life of Castruccio
Castracani, Prince of Lucca in the fourteenth century,
is little more than a romance, in which he has endeavoured
to depict the ideal soldier and statesman.</p>

<p>Machiavelli’s plays and poems will be noticed elsewhere.
They in no respect detract from his reputation.
He came nearer than any contemporary, except Leonardo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
da Vinci, to approving himself a universal genius. No
man of his time stands higher intellectually, and his
want of moral elevation is largely redeemed by his
ample endowment with the one virtue chiefly needful
to an Italian in his day, but of which too many Italians
were destitute&mdash;patriotism.</p>

<p>Patriotism cannot be denied to Machiavelli’s great
counterpart, Francesco Guicciardini, and if it seems
colder and more stained by unworthy subserviency
and political cynicism, it must be remembered that
these defects are the defects of the qualities in which
Guicciardini surpassed his rival. Machiavelli was a
genius of the creative order, and hence, with all his
astuteness, occasionally somewhat Utopian; his life was
free, and his muse licentious. Guicciardini had a great
practical genius, infallible within a narrow sphere. He
does not invent or generalise; his wisdom comes mainly
by experience, and he accepts things for what they are.
“His originality,” says Signor Villari, “though doubtless
considerable, was devoted to giving an exact and most
lucid shape to the current doctrines of his day.” “A
sound judgment,” he himself says in his<cite>Ricordi</cite>, “is
better than a pregnant wit.” He is correct in all the
relations of life, and has not the least turn for writing
comedies. Machiavelli, after all his experiences, still
hopes like an enchanted maiden for the ideal prince.
Guicciardini knows that there is none such, and that,
even if there were, the barbarians would be too strong
for him. He coldly accepts the situation and hires
himself out to a bad Government, with this redeeming
quality, that it is still a Government of Italians by
Italians. It may be said that Machiavelli was willing to
enter the service of the Medici, and such is the fact; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
Florence had owed glorious days to Cosmo and Lorenzo,
and Machiavelli could never have thought or written of
them as Guicciardini did of his Papal employers:</p>

<p>“<em>No one can have a stronger detestation than mine for
the avarice, ambition, and sloth of the priesthood. Nevertheless,
the position I have always held with several pontiffs
has compelled me to love them for mine own advantage; and
but for this consideration I should have loved Martin Luther
as myself, not for the purpose of freeing myself from the
laws introduced by the Christian religion, as it is generally
interpreted and understood, but in order to see this herd of
wretches reduced to their proper condition, namely, that of
their being left either without vices or without authority.</em>”</p>

<p>It had not always been so. The Papal satellite had
been a trusted envoy of the Florentine Government.
Born in 1483, he had studied law at Ferrara and Padua,
become an advocate on his return to Florence, married
advantageously, and in 1512 discharged a mission to
Spain, where he graduated in diplomacy under the
eye of the most crafty and faithless prince of the Age
of Perfidy, Ferdinand the Catholic. The revolution
which restored the Medici occurred in his absence.
He accepted the situation, but instead of serving the
Government at home, passed into the employment of
the Medicean Pope, Leo X., to whom he must have
been highly recommended, for he immediately received
the government of Modena, Reggio, and Parma, recently
added to the states of the Church, in which he showed
the utmost energy and sagacity in suppressing malefactors
and preserving order. From 1524 to 1527 he
was President of the Romagna, and until 1534, when he
retired from the Pope’s service, Governor of Bologna,
and all evidence goes to show that the Papal power was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
never more faithfully served than by the man who held it
in such abhorrence. He cannot be acquitted of having
favoured the overthrow of Florentine liberty in 1530,
and is accused of acts of cupidity and vengeance which
do not seem in harmony with his general character.
He returned to his native city in 1534, hoping to play
an important part under the restored dynasty; but the
youthful Duke Cosmo, who needed no tutor in the arts
of intrigue and dissimulation, gently thrust him aside,
and the disappointed politician solaced his latter years
with the composition of his history. Six years of literary
leisure gave him a renown which his twenty years
of active concern with the world’s business would never
have procured him. He died in 1540, leaving his history
still in want of the last touches.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, the leading fault of this very great
book to have had too many touches already. Guicciardini,
like Gibbon, thought much of his dignity, and
assumed his historical as poets are said to assume their
singing robes. He dropped the easy and vigorous style
in which his fragment upon Florentine history had
been composed in his youth, and wrote in a dignified
and ambitious manner for which nature did not qualify
him. Hence he is tedious, and the impression of
tameness is enhanced by the unsatisfactory character
of the incidents narrated, and the author’s general deficiency
in enthusiasm. With all these defects it is still
one of the most valuable histories ever written. It
might be entitled the History of the Decline and Fall
of Italy, from the French invasion in 1494. For us the
sadness of the picture is relieved by our knowledge of
the splendour of literature and art in an age of complete
dissolution of the body politic; but these redeeming cir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>cumstances
do not enter into Guicciardini’s view: he can
only write as Polybius wrote of the downfall of Greece.
He has much in common with this historian: both men
of affairs; both largely concerned with the events they
describe; both embittered by public calamities and contemptuous
of the capacity of their countrymen; both
patriotic children of a ruined state, while compelled,
and not wholly averse, to adopt intimate association
with the conqueror; neither of them the master of a
good style, but compensating this defect by good sense
and the invaluable political lessons they derive from the
transactions they record.</p>

<p>Another statesman-historian, Ranke, has brought heavy
charges against Guicciardini, both of plagiarism and of
wilful manipulation of facts, but he seems to have been
successfully answered by Signor Villari in his Life of
Machiavelli. Villari, who has had access to the archives
of Guicciardini’s family, is able to show the extent to
which he availed himself of MS. materials, and his care
in working them up into his history. Many of his
statements which have since been shown to be erroneous,
were in conformity with the general belief of his
time.</p>

<p>Guicciardini’s literary glory was enhanced, though his
moral character suffered some injury, by the publication
of his inedited writings in ten volumes in 1857 and
following years. These include, with other important
matter, the fragment of Florentine history to which reference
has been made; his official correspondence as
diplomatist and governor, full of historical information
and practical sagacity; the considerations on Machiavelli,
his friend and fellow-expert in politics, characteristic of
the natures of the two men, so eminent respectively in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
theory and in practice; the<cite>Dialogue on the Government
of Florence</cite>, avowing this ostensible partisan of the
Medici’s secret preference for a republic, though an oligarchical
one; most important of all, the<cite>Ricordi politici e
civili</cite>, maxims and memoranda of a statesman. These
are purely aphoristic, without system or unity beyond
that which they necessarily derive from the constitution
of the mind upon which they have been impressed
by experience and reflection.</p>

<p>“He fully understood,” says Villari, “that by this
plan his counsels and political maxims became nothing
more than simple observations, palliatives and tricks for
the wiser or less wise guidance of the social machine,
apart from all radical reform or the creation of any
new system of political science or moral philosophy,
and still less of any new state or new people. But
he neither hoped nor desired to entertain hopes of so
lofty a nature. System he did not seek, daring hypotheses
were not to his taste; he merely gathered the
fruit of his own and others’ daily experience.” In a
word, Guicciardini was a realist; Machiavelli, for all
his worldly wisdom, an idealist. As the Bishop of
London has remarked: “It is the weakness of Machiavelli’s
political method that, while professing to deal with
politics in a practical spirit, he is not practical enough.”
It would seem Guicciardini’s chief fault to have taken
too limited a view of human affairs, and to have judged
too exclusively from what was happening in his own
corner. The imperfection of historical materials, however,
rendered any attempt at a philosophy of history
extremely difficult, and Guicciardini’s time was too much
occupied by administrative labours for profound investigation.
Notwithstanding his opportunism and political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
pessimism, he had an ideal, and he tells us plainly what
it was:</p>

<p>“<em>I desire to see three things before my death&mdash;but I doubt
I may live long enough without seeing any of them&mdash;a well-ordered
republican mode of life in our own city, the deliverance
of Italy from all barbarians, and the world freed from
the tyranny of these execrable priests.</em>”</p>

<p>The mutability of the world might almost seem to justify
Guicciardini’s hand-to-mouth method of getting through
it. We have seen Petrarch two centuries earlier calling
for the Pope’s return to Rome as the panacea for all the
ills of Italy. Guicciardini would have sided with him in
that age; in his own the same genius of liberty which
spoke by Petrarch’s mouth to demand the Pope’s restoration
speaks by his to demand the Pope’s expulsion.
It was not given to him to see the great value in evil
times of the temporal power&mdash;in good times monstrous&mdash;as
an asylum for what little of independence could
still subsist in Italy, and a testimony, however feeble, to
a moral and spiritual unity destined to develop into a
national unity. But against the Papal sway on its own
merits, apart from the accidental circumstances of the
time, Guicciardini and Machiavelli prophesy like the two
witnesses of the Apocalypse.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>OTHER PROSE-WRITERS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>Italy now possessed a perfect standard of prose. She
had already had one in the fourteenth century, when so
rapid had been the development of the power of expression
that the form had outrun the substance. She could
say anything; but except by the mouth of the novelist
Boccaccio, and that of Petrarch, who preferred to write
his prose in Latin, had found little worthy of emphatic
utterance. It may be partly owing to this poverty of
matter in the vernacular literature, as well as to the
passion for Latin, that style decayed so greatly during
the fifteenth century. Yet, so far as the latter of these
causes operated, the evil brought its own remedy: it
was impossible to be as deeply versed as Pontano or
Politian in the elegances of Latin without becoming
impatient of barbarism and pedantry in Italian. Sannazaro,
an exquisite Latin writer, was perhaps the first
considerable man who insisted on an even standard of
distinction in both languages. Fortunately for Italy, the
<cite>Arcadia</cite> was a very popular book; fortunately, too, the
Latin constructions with which it is replete were not
so easily imitated as its general refinement of phrase.
By the time of Leo X. inelegance had almost disappeared
from Italian literature, and Italy might boast her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>self
the only country in Europe that possessed a perfect
literary language; wanting, indeed, the golden simplicity
of the thirteenth century, but still the prose of cultivated
men, and adequate for every form of literary composition.
The intellectual distinction thus conferred upon
the nation, combined with her still more pronounced
superiority in the arts, seemed, as with Greece in similar
circumstances, to regain for her a dominion more illustrious
than that of which she had been despoiled. For
a hundred years her authors were the arbiters of taste
and the models of Europe, a sovereignty which might
have been prolonged had it been possible for her to
place herself on the right and victorious side in the
great battle for civil and religious freedom that resounded
throughout the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As in all countries at their first awakening to an era
of literary culture, this culture had gone deep enough to
produce a multitude of authors, but not deep enough to
generate a literary public capable of supporting them.
The appetite for fame and the delight in authorship
filled the ranks of literature with aspiring recruits, but
the commissariat, without which no army can keep the
field, had to be supplied by patronage, either from individuals
or the state. Hence, except when some wealthy
noble like Angelo di Costanzo was smitten with the
passion for literary fame, we usually find the writers of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, even when most
illustrious, in a condition of dependence. When with
this is considered the utter absence of civil freedom (for
Venice, the one free city, hospitable to authors, allowed
little liberty to printers), it is remarkable that the servility
of the writers should have extended so little beyond
their dedications. Especially is this the case with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>tory,
which, notwithstanding the influences at work to
disfigure and corrupt it, remained on the whole surprisingly
impartial. This must be ascribed in great part to
the influence of classic models; partly, also, to the real
mental superiority of most of those who in the sixteenth
century essayed this form of composition.</p>

<p>No form is more attractive than the historical to
men ambitious to shine in letters, and conscious of
high talent without creative genius. “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">No merita il nome
di creatore, se non Iddio ed il Poeta</i>;” but delineation
of character and representation of events are as it
were an inferior kind of creation out of pre-existing
material, like that ascribed by ancient theology to the
Demiurgus. The literary genius of Italy addressed itself
eagerly to the task. Ere long almost every considerable
state had its vernacular historian. Some of the most
important writers, nevertheless, continued to compose
in Latin. Among these the most eminent was that very
secular prelate and not very trustworthy historian P<small>AOLO</small>
G<small>IOVIO</small>, Bishop of Nocera (1483-1552), one of the men
whose chief title to fame in our day is to have been
famous in their own, but who was certainly reckoned
as the chief historian of his time, and whose biographies
of eminent men of letters and illustrious captains are
still found valuable. Part of his general history of his
own times perished in the sack of Rome (1527), and,
with a sensitiveness not dishonourable to him, he shrank
from recording the transactions of a time when the vials
of wrath seemed so visibly poured out upon the Papacy.
Except for the gaps indicated, his history extends from
1494 to 1547. Literature sustained a heavy loss in the
disappearance of the work of Andrea Navagero, another
Latin historian (1483-1529), who had been entrusted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
the Venetian Government with the history of their Republic.
The loss of another historian&mdash;Girolamo Borgia,
who wrote the history of Italy in the days of Alexander
VI. and Julius II.&mdash;is greatly to be deplored, not because
he was distinguished as a writer, but because he was a
Borgia.</p>

<p>The historian of Florence had given the first example
of really classic Italian history, and Florence, though
backward in comparison with Venice in the diffusion of
literature by the art of printing, still took the lead among
Italian cities in literary as well as artistic cultivation.
A group of Florentine annalists sprung up, whose pens
were chiefly exerted for the honour of their birthplace.
Their candour generally prevented the publication of
their works in their lifetime. Such is the case with
J<small>ACOPO</small> N<small>ARDI</small>, who wrote the history of Florence from
the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 to their final restoration
in 1530, “with sincerity of intention and painstaking
accuracy” (Symonds), but also with the acrimony to be
expected from a banished patriot who fought for liberty
to the last, and for the remainder of his life ate the bread
of exile at Venice. The style is accused of aridity; but
his translation of Livy is regarded as one of the best in
the Italian language. His own history was not published
until 1582, nor that of his continuator Segni until 1713,
although this elegant historian, whose work occupies
the period from 1527 to 1555, was a partisan of the
Medici. A portion of the same epoch, from 1527 to
1538, is described much more diffusely by B<small>ENEDETTO</small>
V<small>ARCHI</small>, one of the most prolific men of letters of his
time. Varchi, though a devotee of the liberty of whose
restoration he despaired, wrote by the special commission
of the Grand Duke Cosmo, which neither affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
his impartiality nor protected him from being nearly
murdered by some private persons who had been
offended by his honesty, nor prevented his history
from remaining in MS. until the eighteenth century.
In 1570 S<small>CIPIONE</small> A<small>MMIRATO</small>, a Neapolitan, received a
commission from the Grand Duke to write a general
history of Florence, which he brought down to 1574.
His free access to archives enabled him to be more
accurate than any predecessor. He also compiled some
valuable genealogical works. The history of Ferrara
was written by Pigna, and that of Genoa by Foglietta
and Bonfadio, all of whom may be considered
standard historians. The same can hardly be said of
any other of the numerous local writers whom Italy produced
in this age, except Porzio, the historian of the
conspiracy of the Neapolitan barons against King Ferdinand;
Graziani, who recounted the Venetian wars in
Cyprus; and three others who deserve notice not merely
as historians but as typical figures.</p>

<p>Never since Petrarch’s day had the sceptre of Italian
literature rested so unequivocally in one hand as in
P<small>IETRO</small> B<small>EMBO’S</small> during the second quarter of the sixteenth
century. In one respect Bembo’s pre-eminence
is even more remarkable than his predecessor’s, for
Petrarch towered immeasurably above any possible competitor
except Boccaccio, while Bembo was so far from
being the first man of his day that he was not even a
man of genius. His wonderful gift for felicitous imitation,
whether in prose or verse, was unaccompanied by
any power of original thought. But he possessed beyond
any contemporary the formal perfection of style, whether
in Latin or Italian, demanded by the age. His History
of Venice, which alone concerns us here, was originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
published in the former language, but Bembo vindicated
his claim to a place among Italian historians by himself
translating it into Italian. He had succeeded Andrea
Navagero as Venetian historiographer in 1529.</p>

<p>Born at Venice in 1470, and son of the magistrate who
so honourably distinguished himself by raising a monument
to Dante at Ravenna, Bembo had all his life enjoyed
the favour of the great. He had been the Platonic admirer
of Lucrezia Borgia, who had honoured him with
the shining tress and the dull letters religiously preserved
in the Brera Library at Milan. Leo X. had made him
his secretary before issuing from his own conclave, and,
with munificence for once well applied, had provided him
with means to occupy a delicious retreat at Padua, where
he was residing when he received the Venetian commission.
At a later period Paul III., who loved to surround
himself with illustrious men, raised him to the Cardinalate
and drew him to Rome, where he died in 1547,
more admired and lamented than any man of letters of
his time. His history, which extends from 1487 to 1513,
and which he composed with his eye upon Cæsar, is the
image of the writer, perfect in the harmony of its periods,
and carrying the reader rapidly along its smooth surface,
but surface alone, describing every occurrence as the
ordinary man saw it and the statesman did not, with no
attempt to search out the secret springs of action, no
reference to documents public or private, and, which is
more surprising, no effort to delineate a remarkable
character. That this would not have exceeded his
powers is shown by his beautiful portrait of the Duchess
of Urbino, in his Latin life of her husband.</p>

<p>Bembo’s successor, P<small>IETRO</small> P<small>ARUTA</small> (1540-98), who
continued his history to 1551, typifies the statesman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
historian, versed in diplomacy and public business, and
so highly endowed with the qualifications demanded by
such employments as to have become Procurator of the
Republic, and to have been prevented only by his death
from becoming Doge. He was consequently well fitted
to write the annals of a state like Venice, and his
work stands high among Italian histories. The third
exceptional historian of the age, typical of the accomplished
literary amateur, is A<small>NGELO DI</small> C<small>OSTANZO</small>, a
Neapolitan noble whom we shall meet again among the
poets. He wrote the history of Naples from 1250 to
1486, and is interesting as the pupil of Sannazaro, the
friend of Vittoria Colonna, a patrician whose love of
letters led him to cultivate authorship, and a patriot
whose love of country gave umbrage to the jealous
Spanish viceroy, and subjected him to perpetual confinement
to his estates. His history does not disappoint the
favourable prepossessions thus aroused, being composed
with great elegance and dignity, and a manifest love of
truth; insomuch that the author of the modern standard
history of Naples, Giannone, while supplying Costanzo’s
defects by close attention to jurisprudence, public economy,
and other subjects neglected by his predecessor,
has transfused most of the latter’s narrative into his own.</p>

<p>Biography, the most attractive form of prose composition,
was also well represented in this age, but inspired
only two standard works, extremely unlike in style
and spirit, but both possessions for all time, and both
relating to the line arts. G<small>IORGIO</small> V<small>ASARI</small> (1512-74),
biographer-general of painters, sculptors, and architects,
may be called the Herodotus of art; a practitioner
himself, and acquainted with many of the
persons whom he describes; lively and garrulous, appa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>rently
most artless, he possesses either the science or
the knack of felicitous composition in an extraordinary
degree. Living when picturesque stories about artists
were accepted without question, he is entirely unembarrassed
in relating such as commend themselves to
him, to the joy of the readers and the scandal of the
critics of the future. It is probable that scepticism of
the truth of his anecdotes and the authority due to his
attributions of pictures has gone much too far; but
however this may be, criticism will never be able to
turn his living book into a dead one, or to invalidate our
debt to him for the mass of unquestionably authentic
particulars which he has preserved. His good taste in
art as well as in literature is evinced by his admiration
for the first-fruits of the early Tuscan school, neglected
in his day, and his character appears throughout his
work in the most amiable light. His chief defect, a serious
one, is the imperfection of his information respecting the
important schools of Lombardy and Venice.</p>

<p>There is little amiability in a still more distinguished
writer, whose pen has gained him the immortality which
he expected from the chisel and the graver. B<small>ENVENUTO</small>
C<small>ELLINI</small> (1501-71) was undoubtedly a very eminent artist;
yet the autobiography which has preserved his name,
while those of Pompeo Tarcone and Alessandro Cesati
are forgotten, is a greater work of art than any he
accomplished in his own vocation. It may be compared
to the realistic sculpture of Donatello, surpassing in
vigour and animation the ideal models of which it falls
short in elegance and grace. It is the counterpart of
a man, and a very manly man, all muscle and sinew and
rude force, a boaster, a bully, a libertine, a duellist,
almost an assassin, one whom a slight change of circum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>stances
would easily have made a brigand or a bravo
but always the artist. No book, it is probable, gives a
better idea of the general atmosphere of the Italy of
the sixteenth century; assuredly no other delineation is
nearly so vivid. With truly Pepysian unconsciousness
the writer depicts in himself the man of turbulent and
impracticable character moving among princes and
nobles, outraging their forbearance by every action of
his life, and revenging himself for their exhausted
patience by malicious truth or reckless calumny. The
general fidelity of the picture, however, does not depend
upon the accuracy of particular statements, and Cellini’s
untruths where his own vanity is concerned do not
impair his claim to confidence as a delineator of his
age. Of the literary merit of his performance it is needless
to speak; if not at the very head of entertaining
autobiographies, it is at least second to none. The English
reader will be continually reminded of Haydon;
although, however, Haydon’s confidence in himself was
no less robust than Cellini’s, he had far less reason for
it, nor, with all his vividness, is he the Italian’s equal in
graphic power.</p>

<p>One other prose-writer of the period, and perhaps only
one, may be considered as much an author for all time
as Vasari and Cellini. This is B<small>ALDASSARE</small> C<small>ASTIGLIONE</small>,
whose<cite>Cortegiano</cite> depicts the ideal life of the accomplished
Italian courtier&mdash;a character of more importance in that
day than he can be in ours. In Castiglione’s time not
only were the court and good society almost convertible
expressions, but the relation of the courtier to the court
was far more intimate than it can be now. It actually
was his sphere, which he seldom forsook except when
absent on military enterprises or public business; he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
in habits of daily intercourse with his sovereign, and
professed courtesy and civility as others professed arts
or trades. A competent writer on the court and its
accomplishments, therefore, was necessarily an instructor
in manners and refinement, and as such might exercise
an important influence on his age. While the equally
accomplished Casa, in his<cite>Galateo</cite>, instructed the average
gentleman in good manners, the courtier’s training fell
to the lot of Castiglione, than whom no man could be
better qualified either by actual disposition or the circumstances
of his life. A Mantuan by birth, he had
served the Duke of Urbino, had exemplified Italian refinement
at the English court on a mission to receive
the Garter for his sovereign, and when he wrote (1518),
was envoy at the court of Leo X., and the intimate friend
of the most cultivated men of his age.</p>

<p>The machinery of his book is a report, imaginary in
form, but faithful in spirit, of dialogues held at the court
of Urbino among the distinguished persons who frequented
it at various times. They are by no means
frivolous; Castiglione’s standard, not merely of deportment
and manly exercise, but of intellectual accomplishment,
is very high. The conversations deal with such
themes as the preferable form of government and the
condition of women, and are handled with signal elegance,
acumen, and graceful but not cumbrous erudition.
They are interspersed with pleasant stories admirably
told, and would give a fascinating idea of Italian court
life, were it not so evident that its darker features have
been kept out of view, and that the general relation of
Castiglione’s picture to reality is that of Sannazaro’s
Arcadia to the actual life of shepherds. Yet the picture
has many elements of truth, and it speaks well for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
age that it could produce even such an ideal. “Carried
to the north of Europe,” says Mr. Courthope, “and
grafted on the still chivalrous manners of the English
aristocracy, the ideal of Castiglione contributed to form
the character of Sir Philip Sidney.” The delicacy of
Castiglione’s sentiments is shown by his bitter mortification
at the unjust reproaches of Clement VII., into whose
service he afterwards entered, and who accused him of
failure as a diplomatist. These are said to have broken
his heart. He died in 1529. Raphael had painted his
portrait, his tomb was designed by Giulio Romano, and
his epitaph was written by Bembo.</p>

<p>“Love rules the court, the camp, the grove.” The
<cite>Asolani</cite> of Bembo, therefore, a disquisition on Love
from different points of view, composed in imitation of
Cicero’s Tusculan Questions, should take precedence of
Castiglione’s<cite>Cortegiano</cite>, but it can hardly be said that it
does. The<cite>Cortegiano</cite> is a piece of real life, indicating, if
not precisely what the highest Italian society was, at all
events what it felt it ought to be. Bembo’s dialogues, or
rather monologues, might have been composed in any
age of refinement; they are purely academical in form,
and the perpetual justice of the sentiments is purchased
by perpetual commonplace. Seldom, however, have
commonplaces been set off with such harmony and
polish of style, or with more ingenious eloquence, especially
at the conclusion, where the Hermit reconciles
Love’s advocates and his accusers by descanting on the
charms of ideal beauty. If it be true that to have read
it was the indispensable passport to good society, the
circumstance is creditable to the age’s literary taste, and
still more so to its standard of ideal excellence. Bembo’s
prose is more satisfactory than his poetry, perhaps be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>cause
it raises less expectation; in verse the wonder is
that he attains no further, and in prose that he attains
so far.<cite>Gli Asolani</cite>, first published in 1505, was written
at the age of twenty-eight, and was dedicated to Lucrezia
Borgia. On the strength of it Bembo is made the chief
interlocutor in Castiglione’s<cite>Cortegiano</cite> when the question
of love is touched upon.</p>

<p>The number of writers at this period who, if not
always moral, may be described as moralists, is very
considerable. A<small>LESSANDRO PICCOLOMINI</small>, afterwards
Archbishop of Patras, wrote a complete institution of
the citizen which is not devoid of merit; but he is better
remembered by a sin of his youth, the<cite>Dialogo della
bella creauza delle donne</cite>, in which an Italian Martha
successfully exhorts an Italian Margaret to add a lover
to a husband. The literary merits of this otherwise
reprehensible performance are considerable; it is also
an authority on cosmetics. Sperone Speroni, eminent
for the dignity of his life and the elegance of his style,
has the further honour of having first employed the
dialogue in the discussion of purely ethical questions.
Lodovico Dolce and A. F. Doni, industrious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateurs</i>,
obtained a reputation in their own day which posterity
has not ratified. The former, says Tiraboschi, wrote
much in every style and well in none; the latter is
tersely characterised by Niceron as “grand diseur de
riens.” Far superior is G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> G<small>ELLI</small>, the
learned tailor of Florence, who had the great advantage
over the other moralists of being able to clothe
his wit and wisdom in an objective form. In his<cite>Circe</cite>,
Ulysses is represented as unsuccessfully endeavouring
to persuade his metamorphosed companions to reassume
human shape. They know better, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
argumentation might well have suggested the machinery
of Dryden’s<cite>Hind and Panther</cite>; even as that of Gelli’s
<cite>Capricci</cite>, where Giusto disputes with his own soul, was
very probably copied in Smollett’s<cite>Adventures of an
Atom</cite>.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic writers of the time is
A<small>GNOLO</small> F<small>IRENZUOLA</small> (1497-1547), an authority “on the
form and colour of the ear, and the proper way of wearing
ornamental flowers,” whose elegant and frequently
licentious stories, idiomatically Tuscan in style, fresh in
humour, and brilliant in description, are interwoven with
his<cite>Dialoghi d’Amore</cite>, and who also gained fame by his
comedies, and as the translator, or rather adapter, of
Apuleius. As the combination of the photographic portraits
of several members of any class of society gives the
mean average of its physiognomy, so Firenzuola represents
the average constitution of such men of letters of
his day as wrote with a real vocation for literature. It is
doubtful whether any such vocation can be credited to
another satirist who greatly surpassed him in celebrity,
the notorious P<small>IETRO</small> A<small>RETINO</small> (1492-1556). Aretino was
merely a literary blackmailer, whose profligate and venal
pen was employed to extort or cajole money from the
great men of the age. His indubitable success is difficult
to understand, except as the irrepressible and irreversible
decree of fashion. Apart from his comedies and his
letters, an amazing record of the abasement of rank
before impudence, only one of his works has any literary
merit, and the genuineness of this is questionable. His
other immoralities are as insipid as his moralities, and his
personalities are of the kind best answered by a cudgel.
Notwithstanding, he became a power in public life as well
as in literature, rivalled the opulence and the pomp of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
friend Titian, and, like him, trained up disciples of his
craft. The charm may have lain in some measure in
the boldness of the man, who alone in his age made
a show of free speech, although the real motor of his
pen was cupidity, who lived libelling, and died laughing.
Worthless as he was, he might have anticipated
Pope’s boast that men not afraid of God were afraid
of him.</p>

<p>Aretino is only one among a host of letter-writers, who
included the most accomplished men of the age. Bembo
appears as its typical representative, here as elsewhere,
although the unfortunate historian Bonfadio is held to
have written best. All wrote with an eye to the publication
of their epistles, and asked themselves what Cicero
would have said in their place. None had the delightful
candour and exuberance of Petrarch; they are in consequence
much less national, interesting, and human; and
their letters, stripped of the complimentary phrases which
eke them out, are in general brief. Yet it would be hard
to refuse any among them the praise due to two excellent
qualities, good style and good sense. Such were the
general characteristics of the age, a period, but for
Ariosto, almost devoid of creative power in letters, yet
fully worthy to be ranked with the other great eras of
artificial literature, the eras of Augustus, and Anne, and
Louis XIV. Its truest praise is perhaps afforded by a
comparison of it with the other contemporary literatures
of Europe, then, the French excepted, which is
immensely indebted to the Italian, almost equally destitute
of genius and of art, although the magnificent
rhythm of English prose even then showed what an
instrument had been provided for performers yet to
come. But temporal and spiritual tyranny were fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
destroying the elementary requisites of great literature
in Italy. The hare was lamed, and the tortoises
were overtaking her. A little while yet, and it would be
needful to look beyond Alp and sea for the true Italy,
and find her in the bosoms of Shakespeare, Spenser, and
Sidney.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>THE PETRARCHISTS</small></h2>


<p>We have seen that the definite result of the literary ferment
which accompanied the revival of vernacular Italian
literature after the long torpor of the fifteenth century
was the recognition of literary form, rather than intellectual
substance, as the principal object of cultivation,
a conclusion completely in harmony with the national
genius as well as the national traditions. Had this
been otherwise, revolt would soon have made itself
evident. On the contrary, however, we meet with
scarcely any manifestation of the existence of a romantic
spirit in Italian literature until Manzoni begins to be
inspired by Scott and Byron, and Foscolo by Rousseau.
The consequence is a great lack of richness and
variety in comparison with a literature like the English,
where all descriptions of tendencies have been allowed
ample scope, and now one, now another, has successively
seemed to be predominant; but none, except now and
then for a time, has attained an absolute mastery.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the devotion of the Italian writers to
elegance and symmetry of composition has rendered their
literature a model for cultured writers in all languages, has
deeply influenced contemporary literatures in their rudimentary
stages, and has preserved many a writer from
oblivion whose original power was not conspicuous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
whose themes have long since become antiquated, but
who still challenges the attention of posterity by charm
of style. “Cela qui n’est pas écrit ne dure pas” is a rule
without exception, and the converse is often, though not
always, true also. One highly important class of these
writers is that large section of the poets who modelled
themselves avowedly on the greatest master of style their
literature possessed or possesses, the man whose thoughts,
often most precious in themselves, are displayed to incomparable
advantage by incomparable felicity of expression.</p>

<p>Very few Italian lyrical poets of the sixteenth century
ventured to stray far from the traces of Petrarch,
who became to them what Virgil and Homer and Ovid
had necessarily become to writers in Latin verse. Had
Petrarch excelled in epic as he excelled in lyric, Ariosto
and Tasso too would have been his humble followers, and
the whole of the poetical literature of the age would
have been imitative, and consequently second-rate. Yet,
although the mass of this derivative literature is intolerably
empty and insipid, much is distinguished by a
perfection of expression which makes it not merely
delightful reading but a valuable study. The poets frequently
seem to approach Petrarch very nearly, but none
reproduce him. Those succeed best whose imitation is
the least avowed, and who are most remote from their
model in native temperament, such as Tansillo; on the
other hand, Bembo, Molza, and their like, who in mere
form have most nearly approached Petrarch by most
completely suppressing their own individuality, present
much less to interest modern readers, although their
contemporaries, estimating them from another point of
view, extolled them to the skies.</p>

<p>Bembo and Molza, nevertheless, only followed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
track of the gifted man whom we have already seen so
influential in the development of Italian prose&mdash;Jacopo
Sannazaro. Sannazaro’s attention was, indeed, principally
given to Latin poetry. But the qualifications of
an eminent Latinist and of a pattern Petrarchist were
much the same. Both abdicated all claim to originality
by setting before themselves a model which it was taken
for granted&mdash;and with justice&mdash;that they would be for
ever unable to rival. Sannazaro was, notwithstanding,
something more than a master of felicitous expression.
His Virgilian<cite>De Partu Virginis</cite>, in which he vied with
the chief contemporary writers of Latin hexameters, Vida
and Fracastoro, is less attractive than his elegies, into
which he has introduced more of personal feeling, or his
Piscatorian Eclogues, in which he has successfully revived
the form, if not the spirit, of ancient composition,
and from which Milton did not disdain to borrow ornaments
for<cite>Lycidas</cite>. As a follower of Petrarch, Sannazaro
stands on a different footing from Bembo and Molza.
Their excellence in their own way is indisputable, but
monotonous: they neither rise nor sink; every poem
of theirs is just as good as every other poem. Sannazaro,
a man of noble character and strong feeling, imports
a personal note into his poetry, and succeeds in
proportion to the clearness with which he can render
this audible. His praise of Petrarch’s Laura, for instance,
is something more than conventionality, and
these lines,<cite>Mors et Vita</cite>, translated by Glassford, express
the sum of much serious meditation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Alas! when I behold this empty show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of life, and think how soon it shall have fled;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I consider how the honoured head</span><br />
is daily struck by death’s mysterious blow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span><br />
My heart is wasted like the melting snow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hope, that comforter, is nearly dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeing these wings have been so long outspread,</span><br />
And yet so sluggish is my flight and low.<br />
But if I therefore should complain and weep&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If chide with love, or fortune, or the fair&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cause I have; myself must bear it all,</span><br />
Who, like a man 'mid trifles lulled to sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With death beside me, feed on empty air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor think how soon this mouldering garb must fall.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Among Sannazaro’s contemporaries, a little too early
to have imbibed the full spirit of the Petrarchan revival,
may be especially named Antonio Tebaldeo (1463-1537),
an admired poet who survived his reputation; Serafino
dell’ Aquila, imitated by Wyat, whose Neapolitan vehemence
betrayed his lively talent into bombast; Antonio
Cammelli, the political laureate of the Ferrarese court;
Antonello Petrucci, who wrote as Damocles banqueted,
with the headsman’s axe suspended over him; Notturno
Neapolitano; and Filosseno, chiefly remarkable for
the undisguised gallantry of his sonnets addressed to
Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

<p>Bembo was a model man of letters, to whom in this
capacity the Italian language and Italian culture are infinitely
beholden. As a poet he is perhaps best characterised
by the forty drawers through which he is said to
have successively passed his sonnets, making some alteration
for the better in every one of them. If there had
been any originality in any of them, this would hardly
have survived the twentieth drawer, but there never had
been, and since the polish was always meant to be the
merit, there hardly could be too much polishing. Bembo’s
poetry at all events serves to refute the heresy which
identities genius with industry; and if we admit with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
Roscoe that “any person of good taste and extensive
reading might, <em>by a due portion of labour</em>, produce works
of equal merit,” we must nevertheless allow that it
will probably be long ere such a capacity for labour
reappears. He entirely fulfilled the requirements of
his own age, by which he was simply idolised. The
quintessence of his contemporaries’ admiration is concentrated
in Vittoria Colonna’s humble yet dignified
remonstrance with him for having failed to celebrate
the death of her husband:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Unkind was Fate, prohibiting the rays<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my great Sun your kindling soul to smite;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toward me, who have too daringly aspired.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Bembo’s Latin poetry, of which charming specimens
may be seen in Symonds’s<cite>Renaissance</cite>, is better than his
Italian, for it does not disappoint. The fame of F<small>RANCESCO</small>
M<small>ARIA</small> M<small>OLZA</small> (1489-1544) was in his day hardly second
to Bembo’s, and was based on much the same grounds.
Like Bembo, he was an elegant Latin poet, who carried
the maxims appropriate for composition in a dead
language into a living one. Like Bembo’s, his vernacular
poems, with one remarkable exception, are models of
diction as inexpressive as harmonious&mdash;a perpetual silvery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
chime which soothes the ear, but conveys nothing to
the mind. The exception is a poem in which the
usual vagueness and emptiness of sentiment assumes
substance from its pastoral setting. The<cite>Ninfa Tiberina</cite>,
in which one of Molza’s innumerable light loves is
idealised as a shepherdess, is just such a piece of
mosaic as Gray’s Elegy. The author has amassed all
the commonplaces of pastoral poetry, and, without
adding a single idea of his own, has combined them
into so rich and glowing a picture that he may well
claim to have superseded the entire school of pastoral
versifiers, the few excepted who have derived their
inspiration from Nature, like his predecessor Politian.
“Molza is to Politian,” says Symonds, “as the rose
to the rosebud.” He was born at Modena, but lived
chiefly at Rome, leaving his wife and family in his
native city. They would indeed have been much in
the way, for he was continually involved in some
amour, and his irregular ties ultimately proved fatal
to him. He was a leading member of the brilliant
literary circles of Rome and Florence, and as a companion
and a man of letters his contemporaries have
nothing but praise for him.</p>

<p>Petrarch is a poet as much within the scope of imitation
as beyond the pursuit of rivalry. The swarms of
Petrarchists stun the ear and darken the light of the
period: Tansillo might well say that every hillock had
grown a Parnassus. They may be found in the thesaurus
of Dolce, a series whose continuous publication
for so many years at all events affords proof that
this appetite for imitative verse was not factitious.
Some few stand forth from the crowd by some exceptional
characteristics, and it is of these only that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
we can speak. The first of these in chronological
order is B<small>ERNARDO</small> T<small>ASSO</small> (1493-1568), whom we have
already met as the author of the<cite>Amadigi</cite>. In his
lyrical as in his epical attempts, Tasso is one of those
provoking poets who are always trembling on the verge
of excellence, ever good, hardly ever quite good enough.
Even the famous sonnet on his renunciation of his lady,
which, Dolce tells us, thrilled Italy, is less eminent for
the beauty of the poetry than the nobility of the sentiment.
Once, however, straying within the domain of
pastoral poetry, he found and polished a gem worthy of
the Greek Anthology:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>The herb and floweret of my verdant shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shepherd, thy pasturing flock’s possession be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thine the olive and the mulberry</span><br />
That mantle these fair hillocks o’er and o’er.<br />
But be my fountain’s fresh and sparkling store<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of gushing waters undisturbed by thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they are vowed to Muses’ ministry,</span><br />
And whoso drinks is poet evermore.<br />
Solely for these and for Apollo fit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Loves and Nymphs the sacred stream doth burst,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or haply some fair swan may drink of it;</span><br />
But thou, if not a swain untutored, first<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy dues to Love in melody acquit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then with the bubbling coolness quench thy thirst.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Another poet of the time vies with Bernardo Tasso
in nobility of character, evinced in his case by the
fervour of his patriotism. The bulk of the verse of
G<small>UIDO</small> G<small>UIDICCIONI</small>, Bishop of Fossombrone (1500-41),
consists of insipid love-strains in the style of Bembo
and Molza; but when he touches upon the wrongs and
misfortunes of his country he becomes inspired, and
speaks in tones of alternate majesty and pathos, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
which the following sonnet superadds the charms of
fancy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>The Arno and the Tiber and the Po<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This sad lament and heavy plaint of mine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hear, for solely I my ear incline,</span><br />
Accompany with music sad and low.<br />
No more Heaven’s light on sunny wave doth glow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more the dwindled lamps of virtue shine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark western tempests, dank and foul with brine,</span><br />
Have swept the meads and laid the flowerets low.<br />
The myrtle, Rivers, and the laurel-spray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Delight and diadem of chosen souls,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sacred shrines the blast hath borne away;</span><br />
No more unto the sea your torrent rolls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exulting, or your Naiades display</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their snowy breasts and shining aureoles.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">If other Italian poets felt like Guidiccioni, they shunned
to give their sentiments utterance. The chief original
poem of A<small>NNIBALE</small> C<small>ARO</small> (1507-66), the accomplished
translator of Virgil and Longus, and one of the best
letter-writers of his age, was a panegyric on the house
of Valois&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venite all’ombra dei gran gigli d’oro</i> (“<em>Hither,
where spread the golden fleurs-de-lis</em>”). A few years
later, with equal genius and equal insensibility to the
part that became an Italian, Caro turned to celebrate
the Spanish conqueror. Whatever may be thought of
the theme of his poem, it is in execution one of the great
things of Italian poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Here the Fifth Charles reposes, at whose name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eyes of superbest monarchs seek the ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom Story’s tongue and Honour’s trump resound,</span><br />
Quelling all loudest blasts of meaner fame.<br />
How hosts and legioned chiefs he overcame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kings, but for him invincible, discrowned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swayed realms beyond Imagination’s bound,</span><br />
And his own mightier soul did rule and tame&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span><br />
This knows the admiring world, and this the Sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That did with envy and amazement see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His equal course with equal glory run</span><br />
Wide earth around; which now accomplished, he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From heaven observant of the world he won,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiling inquires, 'And toiled I thus for thee?'</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">G<small>IOVANNI DELLA</small> C<small>ASA</small> (1500-56) emulated Caro in
the nobility of his style, which would scarcely have been
expected, considering the licentious character of some
of his verse and his ecclesiastical profession. He does,
however, sometimes attain a dignity and gravity which,
apart from the beauty of his diction, lift him high out
of the crowd of Petrarchists; nor are his themes invariably
amorous. His<cite>Galateo</cite>, a treatise on politeness,
has earned him the name of the Italian Chesterfield.
He would have attained greater eminence as a man of
letters but for the distractions of politics and business,
which he deplores in the following sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>To woodland fount or solitary cave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In sunlit hour I plained my amorous teen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or wove by light of Luna’s lamp serene</span><br />
My song, while yet to song and love I clave;<br />
Nor by thy side the sacred steep to brave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Refused, where rarely now is climber seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But cares and tasks ungrateful intervene,</span><br />
And like the weed I drift upon the wave.<br />
And idly thus my barren hours are spent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In realms of fountain and of laurel void,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where but vain tinsel is accounted blest.</span><br />
Forgive, then, if not wholly unalloyed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My pleasure to behold thee eminent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On pinnacle no other foot hath prest.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A<small>NGELO DI</small> C<small>OSTANZO</small> (1507-91), already noticed as an
historian, is another example of a writer of sonnets who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
rose from the crowd by the individuality which he contrived
to impress upon his performances. His great
characteristic is an exquisite elegance, not, as in some
other instances, veiling inanity, but usually the accompaniment
of something well worth saying. The following
piece is a good instance of his power of enhancing,
by ingenious embellishment, a thought interesting and
attractive in itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>River, that from thy Apennine recess,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swollen with surge of tributary snow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Com’st foaming, and thy tawny overflow</span><br />
Hurlest on Samnian vales with headlong stress;<br />
Thy farther shore, inhere Love awaits to bless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I seek, and by thy wrath unharmed would go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thou intendest not my overthrow,</span><br />
With stringent curb thy furious flood repress.<br />
But art thou verily resolved to kill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And purposest that this conclusive day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall jointly terminate my good and ill,</span><br />
Grant me but once to stem thy shock and spray:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My happy errand I would fain fulfil;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Me going spare, returning sweep away.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The general passion for verse naturally extended to
the refined and accomplished ladies of the time. Only
two, however, have gained a permanent position in
Italian literature, as much by their characters as by
their poetry. The muse of V<small>ITTORIA</small> C<small>OLONNA</small> (1490-1547)
chiefly prompted the apotheosis of her husband,
the Marquis of Pescara, “a sworded man whose trade
was blood,” and who, though a great captain, scarcely
possessed a single amiable or magnanimous trait of
character. The pathos of the situation surpasses that
of the verse which it called forth. As a woman, Vittoria
evoked the enthusiastic admiration of her contem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>poraries,
and lives for posterity more in the strains of
Michael Angelo than in her own.</p>

<p>The unhappy fate of G<small>ASPARA</small> S<small>TAMPA</small> (1524-53), who
literally died of love, would have preserved her name
without her verse; she was, nevertheless, a true poetess,
and might have been a great one had she not, like so
many poetesses, struck upon the fatal rock of fluency.
Could her centuries of sonnets be concentrated into a
dozen, she would rank high.</p>

<p>More truly a poet than any of the stricter Petrarchists
is a Neapolitan, L<small>UIGI</small> T<small>RANSILLO</small>, although his advantage
is rather intensity of feeling than superiority in the poetic
art. He must indeed be admitted to have derogated in
some measure from the high standard of taste then
generally prevalent, and to have foreshadowed, though
but in a very trifling degree, the extravagances of the
seventeenth century. This may be forgiven to his
southern ardour and liveliness, and foreign critics are
not likely to perceive the little technical defects so
severely visited upon him by his countrymen. He had
the unspeakable advantage over his competitors of being
devoted to no ideal nymph, but to a real and very great
and very cold lady, the Marchioness del Vasto, wife of
the Viceroy of Naples. Such an attachment was necessarily
Platonic on his part, and imaginary, if so much,
on the lady’s. The first rapture is magnificently expressed
in the sonnet in which the poor knight and
military retainer, whose business in life was to help in
clearing the Mediterranean of Turks, compares his rash
love to the flight of Icarus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Now that my wings are spread to my desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The more vast height withdraws the dwindling land,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wider to wind these pinions I expand,</span><br />
And earth disdain, and higher mount and higher:<br />
Nor of the fate of Icarus inquire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor cautious droop, or sway to either hand;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dead I shall fall, full well I understand;</span><br />
But who lives gloriously as I expire?<br />
Yet hear I my own heart that pleading cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stay, madman, whither art thou bound? descend!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruin is ready Rashness to chastise.</span><br />
But I, Fear not, though this indeed the end;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cleave we the clouds, and praise our destinies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If noble fall on noble flight attend.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suspicion, jealousy, bitterly wounded feeling, open
breach, and hollow reconciliation make up the remainder
of the sonnets, the best of which have few superiors in
any literature for fire and passion. His other poetical
performances are far from inconsiderable. The best
known is the sin of his youth, the<cite>Vendemmiatore</cite>, whose
ultra-Fescennine truth to rustic manners and the licence
of the vintage brought it into the Index, and its author
into gaol. In quite a different key are his delightful
didactic poems,<cite>Il Podere</cite>, on the management of an
estate, and<cite>La Balía</cite>, on the care of children, translated
by Roscoe. Some of his familiar<cite>Capitoli</cite> are very pleasing,
and some of his miscellaneous poems are very fine,
especially this on the Spaniards slain by the Turks at
Castel Nuovo, on the coast of Dalmatia:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Hail, scene of fated Valour’s final stand,<br />

<p class="p1">The graceful poets who thus tuned their harps to the
notes of Petrarch sang within the hearing of a spirit
of another sort, whose verses, had they known them,
they would have compared unfavourably with their own
elegance, but whose appearance in their circle would
have been like that of Victor Hugo’s Pan at the banquet
of the Olympians. M<small>ICHAEL</small> A<small>NGELO</small>, the greatest Italian
after Dante, had not, like Dante, acquired the secret of
poetic form. He indites as on marble with mallet and
chisel; but the inscription is everlasting. “Ungrammatical,
rude in versification, crabbed or obscure in
thought,” as Symonds describes them, Michael Angelo’s
sonnets are yet priceless as a revelation of the man,
more distinct than that vouchsafed by his painting or
sculpture. These tell of his tremendous force; the
deep springs of tenderness in his nature are only to
be learned from the poems, the most important of which
are consecrated to Love, now ideal and impersonal, now
expending itself upon some fair object, masculine or
feminine, but in either case Platonic. Vittoria Colonna
and Tommmaso de’ Cavalieri are the objects of the poet’s
deepest attachment. The following sonnet was most
probably inscribed to Cavalieri:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>By your eyes’ aid a gentle light I see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which but for these mine own would never share;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By your auxiliar feet a load I bear</span><br />
Which my lame limbs refuse to bear for me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span><br />
I, plumeless, yet upon your pinions flee;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When heaven I seek, your soul conducts me there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blushes or pallor at your will I wear;</span><br />
Sun chills and winter warms at your decree.<br />
The fashion of your will prescribeth mine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My thought hath in your thinking taken birth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My speech gives voice to your discourse unspoken.</span><br />
A sunless moon that by herself would shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I were without you; only seen on earth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By light of sun that on her dark hath broken.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The roughness of Michael Angelo’s verse was planed
down by the first editor, his great-nephew, and the true
text has only been retrieved in our time.</p>

<p>Two religious poets stand aloof from the class of
Petrarchists, rather by the nature of their themes than
the quality of their talent. C<small>ELIO</small> M<small>AGNO</small>, a religious
poet of Protestant tendencies, produced a hymn to the
Almighty which ranks among the best canzoni of the
period, and had anticipated Coleridge’s project, which
with him as with Coleridge remained a project, for
a series of similar compositions. G<small>ABRIELE</small> F<small>IAMMA</small>,
Bishop of Chioggia, is in general a tame versifier, but
in two inspired moments produced two of the most
beautiful sonnets in the language: one of which is remarkable
for expressing in an ornate style the thought
of Heine’s famous lyric, “Mein Herz gleicht ganz dem
Meere”; the other, apart from its great beauty, as an
instance of a sonnet which, beginning apparently in a
commonplace style, is vivified through and through by
the last tercet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>Never with such delight the bee in spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the full mead teems with the novel flower,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The baying hound, no more compelled to cower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In covert, doth the hind the forest scour,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passion of love or awe divinely given,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or other ecstasy that God endears.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If joy he hath more joyful than these tears!</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The Cinque Cento period of Italian poetry, which
to the men of that day seemed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> of
artistic achievement, has since received less praise and
exerted less influence than fairly its due. It was a great
thing to have produced works so perfect in form, and
to have refined the language in so eminent a degree.
The general belief, too, that the Italian poetry of this
age was devoid of all but formal excellence involves a
great exaggeration. It is true that the literature of the
period is overloaded with masses of mechanical and conventional
stuff, but Guidiccioni and Casa and Tansillo
are capable on occasion of expressing themselves with
an energy the more impressive from being restrained
within the limits prescribed by a chastened taste, and
many Italian sonnets are even better fitted to be breathed
from the trumpet than warbled to the lute. A great
development in this direction might have been expected,
but for the extinction of political and spiritual liberty.</p>

<p>What the Italian lyric might have become we see in
Milton, who could have written neither his<cite>Lycidas</cite> nor
his sonnets without Tuscan models. He undoubtedly
weighted, without overweighting, both canzone and sonnet
with thought to a degree unparalleled in Italy, but how
much he owed to Italians appears by a comparison of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
his sonnets with those of Wordsworth, who neglected
the traditions which Milton carefully observed. Wordsworth
has even more ripeness of thought and moral
elevation than his predecessor; but while Milton’s work
is immaculate, Wordsworth’s is full of flaws.</p>

<p>With all its defects, the poetry of the Cinque Cento
will survive as a proof that rules of art exist and may
be ascertained, and cannot be safely departed from;
no less than as an example of the embellishment which
even ordinary thoughts may receive from nobility of
diction and breadth of style; and as an instance of the
great part which a literature not too original or too
racy of the native soil may play in moulding and
enriching the literatures of neighbouring and less advanced
nations. Nor can it be fairly judged by itself
as an isolated phenomenon. It was a part, and far
from the most important part, of a stupendous artistic
movement, which spoke more readily and eloquently with
brush and chisel than with pen, and expressed through
their medium much that in an age more exclusively
literary would have been committed to paper.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>HUMOROUS POETRY&mdash;THE MOCK-HEROIC</small></h2>


<p>Numerous as are the poets we have briefly passed in
review, many more might have been added whom it
would have been agreeable to have met in the barren
fifteenth century. The Renaissance had by this time
entered into the blood of Italy, and produced one of
the best effects of impregnation with the classical spirit&mdash;a
passion for fame. This we find as constantly assigned
as a motive of action in public affairs in that day as
humanitarian inducements are in ours; and when it is
considered that the sincerity of the former motive is
much less questionable than that of the latter, it is not
clear that the comparison is wholly to the advantage of
the nineteenth century. Almost every man of any mark
was deeply influenced by it, and it was one of the
most potent instruments in stimulating both literary
and artistic production. The drawback was that the
aspirant to fame was naturally inclined to take the
easiest and most fashionable path, and thus the same
impulse which braced effort suppressed originality.</p>

<p>The sentiment of an age mainly under the sway of
Petrarch naturally encouraged the production of lyrical
poetry, and other styles were neglected in comparison.
Apart from the epical attempts which have been mentioned,
and the dramatic and humorous poems to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
allusion remains to be made, the period has little to
show apart from the lyric, with the exception of some
didactic poems&mdash;the<cite>Balía</cite> and the<cite>Podere</cite> of Luigi
Tansillo, the<cite>Nautica</cite> of Baldi, the<cite>Caccia</cite> of Valvasone,
and two others modelled after Virgil, the<cite>Coltivazione</cite> of
Luca Alamanni, and the<cite>Api</cite> of Giovanni Rucellai, both
excellent examples of the description of poetry which
owes most to artifice and least to inspiration. This
might perhaps pass for a general character of the poetry
of the period, which ranks with the ages of Augustus
and Anne as an example of what exquisite culture can
and cannot effect in the absence of creative power. It
was of high value to succeeding periods by bequeathing
to them a norm and standard of good taste by which
to chasten their frequent aberrations; and, notwithstanding
its almost academical character, it was actually
in vital relation with the literary appetite of its limited
but highly accomplished public. There was not, says
Dolce, a cultivated person in Italy who could not repeat
before it was in print Bernardo Tasso’s sonnet resigning
his mistress to his successful rival, a fact which
proves not only the existence of a general appreciation
of poetry independent of the machinery of reviewing and
the printing-press itself, but also a general preference for
its most refined and dignified examples.</p>

<p>The didactic poems of which we have spoken claim
the less attention, inasmuch as they were in no respect
national. The rules for good didactic poetry are the
same in all languages, and any accomplished versifier
will instruct in agriculture or the chase in much the
same manner in any country, however his local colouring
may vary with his climate. It is otherwise with
satirical, familiar, and mock-heroic poetry. In all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
styles Italian work is individual and characteristic. Satiric
traits are frequent enough in the contemporaries of Dante,
and from one point of view Dante himself may be regarded
as a great satirist. The professed satire, nevertheless,
of modern Italy derives from Horace rather than
Juvenal; it aims at good-humoured raillery rather than
scathing vehemence or corroding virulence; and its impetus
is further moderated by its being generally composed
in the easy and garrulous <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i>. Alessandro
Vinciguerra (born 1480) appears to have first imparted
this stamp; but the great exemplar is Ariosto, whose
satires are not the least ornament of his poetic crown,
yielding little in facetious urbanity to his model Horace.</p>

<p>The vigorous satires of Luigi Alamanni, imitated
in English by Sir Thomas Wyat, evince a remarkable
freedom of speech. Bentivoglio, Aretino, Anguillara,
and other writers of note followed in his track with
varying success. The first to employ blank verse in
satire was Lodovico Paterno, who is perhaps more
exceptionally distinguished for having achieved an epithalamium
to Queen Mary of England without the
least allusion to her restoration of the Roman Catholic
religion. The<cite>Decennali</cite> of Machiavelli, a highly-condensed
sketch in verse of the events of his time, may
also be regarded as a satire; but his reputation as a poet
rather arises from his<cite>Capitoli</cite>, disquisitions in verse in
which Tansillo and many others also excelled, and whose
easy familiarity is hardly to be paralleled in any other
literature, and from his elegant versification of portions
of Apuleius’s<cite>Golden Ass</cite>. F<small>RANCESCO</small> C<small>OPPETTA</small> (1510-1554),
an excellent writer of sonnets, extended the domain
of poetry by constituting himself the first laureate of the
feline species. His ode on the loss of his cat (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">di tutta la</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Soria gloria e splendore</i>, and consequently an Angora) is a
curious blending of parodies of Petrarch with genuine
feeling. He eventually finds comfort in the conclusion
that the object of his affections has been appropriated
by Jupiter and placed among the constellations. Two
brilliant stars never seen before have of late been observable
in the firmament, and the inference is obvious.</p>

<p>Ariosto and Machiavelli, nevertheless, although geniuses
of the first order, rank in familiar poetry below
F<small>RANCESCO</small> B<small>ERNI</small>, better equipped for it by nature and
entirely devoted to its practice. Berni, born at Lamporecchio,
near Florence, about 1497, was a dependant
of the Medici, successively attached to Cardinal Bibbiena
and to Bishop Ghiberti, Papal datary. His life was consequently
for a long time spent at Rome, where he
enjoyed the friendship of the most eminent men of
letters of the period, executed the remodelled version
of Boiardo’s<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> by which his name is
best known, and produced the numerous<cite>Capitoli</cite>, which
would stand high as examples of easy familiar verse,
were it not for their frequent indecency. They gave the
pattern of the style (<cite>Bernesque</cite>) which has derived its
name from him, and in which he has had many successors,
but no absolute rival. Humour, as Roscoe
remarks, is very local. Berni loses much, not merely
by translation, but on perusal by a foreigner. It is
enough for his fame if he continues to be appreciated
in his own country, and that nothing worse happens
to him abroad than must equally happen to the author
of a<cite>Hudibras</cite> or a<cite>Jobsiad</cite>. How well some portions
of his work lend themselves to translation in congenial
hands may appear from a specimen, rendered by Leigh
Hunt, of the poem whose subject is the author’s own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
prodigious laziness. His portrait of himself is very
lifelike, and probably very accurate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>The man, for all that, was a happy man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thought not too much; indulged no gloomy fit;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every one loved him; for the rogue had wit,</span><br />
And knew how to amuse. His fancy ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On thousands of odd things which he had writ:</span><br />

<p class="p1"><em>Choleric he was withal, when fools reproved him;<br />

That the poor eyes would scarcely have been seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had it been suffered to forget its place;</span><br />
But, not approving beards to that amount.<br />
The owner brought it to a sharp account.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Berni’s death did him more honour than his life. The
suppressed dedication to the twentieth canto of his
<cite>Orlando</cite> seems to prove that he had become serious in
his later years, and fallen under Protestant influences;
but this was unknown to Cardinal Cibo, who deemed
him the right sort of man to commend a poisoned
chalice to the lips of Cardinal Salviati; and his refusal,
there is every reason to believe, cost him his own life
(1535). He died with strong symptoms of poison, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
buried hastily without epitaph or monument, and, although
his works were collected, nothing was said of the
author. This sudden silence corroborates the suspicion
of his Protestantism.</p>

<p>Berni’s chief characteristics as a poet are graceful ease
and perfect mastery of style and diction. He is fluent
and entirely unembarrassed, never at a loss for the right
word, and handles the difficult <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">terza rima</i> with the facility
of prose. This command of language would have raised
him high if he had possessed any of the elements of
greatness; but he is incapable of elevated sentiment, and
has the good sense never to aspire to it. What is most
admirable in him, his poetical gift apart, is the evident
sincerity and consistency of his Epicurean view of life,
and his eupeptic sanity. As regards his strictly original
compositions, he occupies about the same position in
Italian poetry as Goldsmith would have filled in English
if he had written nothing but<cite>Retaliations</cite> and<cite>Haunches
of Venison</cite>. In his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i> of Boiardo’s<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite>
he has attempted something more considerable,
and, from his own point of view, with much success.
Modern taste will hardly sympathise with his disfigurement
of the romantic grace and simple sincerity of the
original, for the mere sake of heightening the comic
element and improving its style. In his own day men
thought differently, and it must be admitted that the
disparity between Boiardo’s comparatively unadorned
groundwork and the brilliant superstructure of Ariosto
marred the continuity of the<cite>Orlando</cite> as a whole, and
that the chasm may well have seemed to require filling
up. Berni could not impart the special qualities of
Ariosto, but he could bring Boiardo’s style more nearly
up to Ariosto’s level, and he could adorn his original by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
graceful introductions to the respective cantos. Both
these objects have been achieved with taste and success;
and although Boiardo’s comparatively artless composition
is still the best, as nearest to Nature, it cannot be
denied that Berni’s alterations must have appeared to
his contemporaries great improvements, and that his
embellishments may be read with abundant pleasure.
Conscious of his lack of poetical invention, he has
abstained from interfering with the narrative. His work
was not published until after his death, and there is
reason to suspect that it was considerably adulterated by
or at the instance of the great literary bully of the day,
Pietro Aretino.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Berni had any intention of
parodying the<cite>Orlando Innamorato</cite> in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rifacimento</i>; he
simply wished to bring it, in his conception, nearer to
the literary level of the continuation which had superseded
it, and deemed that this could be best effected by
an infusion of humour and satire. It would be a still
greater error to assume, with some modern Italian critics,
an intention on the part of Boiardo and Ariosto of parodying
the old chivalric romance. They merely desired
to adapt it to the spirit of their own age, as Tennyson
has adapted the<cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite> to ours, and their
sprightliness is the correlative of his moral earnestness.
Ariosto is less reverent of his original than Boiardo, but
he keeps within bounds. The great success of his poem,
however, was sure to evolve a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bona-fide</i> parodist, as in
our day Mark Twain has capered with cap and bells in
the wake of Tennyson. The Italian Mark Twain was
T<small>EOFILO</small> F<small>OLENGO</small> (1491-1544), known under his pseudonym
of<cite>Merlinus Cocaius</cite> as a distinguished cultivator
of macaronic poetry, a by-path of literature which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
are compelled to leave unexplored. He was a dissipated
runaway monk, who repented, became serious, and
resought his cell just as he seemed within an ace of
turning Protestant. His<cite>Orlandino</cite> is a burlesque upon
the poems of chivalry, with pieces of genuine poetry
interspersed, and many digressions on the corruptions
of the age, especially the vices of the religious orders.
It is unfinished. What was published is said to have
been written in three months, a statement confirmed
by the energy of the verse.</p>

<p>It was a great step in Greek comedy when the mythological
parodies which had constituted the substance
of the middle comedy were replaced by the picture of
contemporary manners which formed the staple of the
new. So great an advance could not be made by
A<small>LESSANDRO</small> T<small>ASSONI</small> (1565-1638), the chief representative
of serio-comic poetry in the seventeenth century, for
his age would not have tolerated it; but he effected much
in the same direction by converting the mere parody of
the chivalric romance which had satisfied his predecessors
into the mock-heroic epic, a form of literature which,
if he did not invent, he may claim to have perfected.
Instead of contriving burlesque variations upon Ariosto,
he took a real incident of a serio-comic nature&mdash;the war
which in the thirteenth century had actually broken out
between the republics of Modena and Bologna respecting
a bucket carried off by the former. The treatment
is admirable; the characters, some of whom are
historical, and others sketched after Tassoni’s contemporaries,
have an air of reality altogether wanting to
the personages of Folengo’s parodies; there is enough
of idyllic charm and tender pathos here and there to
approve the writer a true poet, while humour domi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>nates,
and many of the sarcasms are really profound. A
more biting irony on the wretched dissensions which
had been the ruin of Italy cannot be conceived; and,
notwithstanding a subordinate purpose of deriding
Tasso’s languid imitators, and the personal quarrel
which prompted composition in the first instance, such
was probably the main purpose of the writer, in his
political sentiments and aspirations a statesman of the
type of Machiavelli and Guicciardini, who burned with
hatred of the Spanish oppressor, but, except for the two
Philippics he composed in demonstration of the real
hollowness of the Spanish power, could find no other
vent for his patriotism than his poetry, and wasted his
life in the service of petty princes.<cite>La Secchia Rapita</cite>
(<cite>The Rape of the Bucket</cite>) was published under a pseudonym
at Paris in 1622, having long circulated in manuscript.
Tassoni also showed himself a bold if bilious critic of
Petrarch, against whose predominance a reaction was
declaring itself, and participated in the general anti-Aristotelian
movement of his times by a volume of
miscellaneous reflections.</p>

<p>A contemporary of Tassoni is usually named along
with him as a master of the heroi-comic style, but is in
every respect greatly his inferior. This is F<small>RANCESCO</small>
B<small>RACCIOLINI</small> (1566-1645), whose pen, if he really meant
to serve the Church by ridiculing the classical mythology,
should have been wielded a century sooner. Part
of the humour of his<cite>Scherno degli Dei</cite> consists in the
unconscious anachronism. It manifests considerable
fertility of invention, and has survived the author’s four
epics, placed as these were immediately after Tasso’s
by good judges in his own day. The<cite>Malmantile
Racquistato</cite> of Lorenzo Lippi the painter, the delight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
of the philologist for its idiomatic Tuscan, is remarkable
for embalming much local folk-lore, and so many
local phrases as to be shorter than its own glossary.</p>

<p>Two more recent examples of the mock-heroic epic
maybe included here to complete the subject. The<cite>Ricciardetto</cite>
of N<small>ICOCOLÒ</small> F<small>ORTEGUERRI</small>, published under the
pseudonym of Carteromaco, has received much merited
and more unmerited praise. The author (1670-1730) was
a prelate of the Roman court, and so great a favourite
of Pope Clement XII. that he is said to have died
from mortification at having displeased his patron by
neglecting to ask for a vacant appointment. His poem
burlesques the chivalric epics of Ariosto and others,
not with the refined raillery of a Berni, but in a style
of broad, coarse buffoonery. It was published after his
death, when his friends sought to extenuate its unclerical
character by alleging that it had been undertaken for a
wager, composed in spare intervals of time, and never
designed for publication. All these statements seem to
be groundless. It has considerable merit as a burlesque,
and some passages indicate a talent for serious poetry
which might have developed into something considerable;
in the main, however, the ability displayed is of
a low though drastic strain. The best idea is that of
making the Saracen champion Feraù turn hermit, a
character which he supports less in the fashion of St.
Jerome than of Friar Tuck.</p>

<p>It seems an instance of apparent injustice in prevalent
literary opinion that the<cite>Ricciardetto</cite> should be so
widely known, while no less a poem than Leopardi’s
Supplement (<cite>Paralipomeni</cite>) to Homer’s Battle of the
Frogs and the Mice is hardly mentioned. The wonder,
however, is not so great as it seems. Forteguerri wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
what all could understand, while Leopardi only cared to
please exceptional readers, and was, moreover, compelled
to shroud much of his satire in obscurity for fear of the
ruling powers. The allegory, nevertheless, is sufficiently
transparent. The vanquished mice are the people of Italy;
the frogs are the priesthood and other accomplices of the
powers of darkness; the crabs, who turn the scale in
the latter’s favour, are the Austrians. The weakness and
disunion of the oppressed, no less than the brutality of
the oppressor, are depicted with the most refined sarcasm.
Nothing can be more humorous, for example, than
the crab’s exposition to the mouse of the principle of
the balance of power; and through all the fancy and
drollery pierce the grief and rage of a patriotic Italian.
There are also fine flashes of true poetry, especially near
the end, when the adventurous mouse visits the underworld
of his species; and Ariosto is parodied as well
as Dante. The satire, nevertheless, transcends the appreciation
of ordinary readers; and it certainly does
appear somewhat singular that the fastidious author,
who composed so sparingly and with such difficulty
upon the most exalted themes, should have bestowed so
much labour upon a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>THE NOVEL</small></h2>


<p>The novel presents one of the most remarkable examples
in literary history of arrested development, and of all
departments of literature is perhaps the only one which
failed to attain perfection in the hands of the ancients.
Great progress is indeed observable from its first artless
beginnings under the Pharaohs, so recently recovered
for us; but having advanced far along several lines, it
becomes stationary upon all. The germ of the picaresque
novel is clearly discernible in Petronius, of the
novel of adventure in Apuleius, of erotic fiction in
Longus; but these examples apparently remain ineffectual.
Either the path is not prosecuted at all, or it leads
to mere repetition. No new element appears until we
encounter the chivalric romance, which in Spain produced
an extensive prose literature, but in Italy ran
almost entirely to verse. The more elaborate romances
of Boccaccio, indeed, disclose influences from this
quarter; but their reputation was slight in comparison
with those short and familiar tales, commonly founded
upon some anecdote and dealing with scenes and personages
of real life, which prescribed the form for the
national novelette. A more distinctively national type
never existed. The extraordinary thing is that the nation
never got beyond it. It should have seemed an obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
advance to lengthen the stories; to stimulate surprise
and suspense by greater intricacy of plot; to embellish
by elaborate description; to depict character with fulness
and exactness; to employ fiction for the ventilation
of ideas. Precedents for all these improvements,
except the last, might have been found in the classical
romances, and it might have been expected that fiction
would have experienced the same development as other
branches of literature. On the contrary, the last Italian
novelette is as far from the novel of the nineteenth
century as the first, and the most powerful literary agent
of good or evil, next to the equally modern newspaper,
remained to be created in recent times. Whatever the
defects of the Italian novel of the sixteenth century, it
was nevertheless, unlike the drama, a thoroughly national
form of composition, it was far in advance of anything
of the kind existing elsewhere, and it exerted great influence
on the literature of other countries as the general
storehouse of dramatic plots.</p>

<p>It is no doubt to the credit of Italian novelists as
artists that they did not overload their stories with
didactic purpose; but this was an error which, writing
mainly to amuse, they lay under little temptation to
commit. None of them were endowed with creative
imagination; none transcended the sphere of ordinary
experience, or showed the least inclination to effect for
prose fiction what Boiardo and Ariosto had accomplished
for narrative poetry. Their <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">notti piacevoli</i> were
not Arabian Nights. Their object of amusing could consequently
only be achieved by keeping close to actual
manners, and we may depend upon receiving from them
a tolerably accurate picture of Italian society in so far
as it suited them to present it; although the portion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
best lent itself to their objects was the most licentious
and corrupt, and the loose women and salacious priests
who recur in their tales from generation to generation,
though by no means creatures of imagination, are still
far from typical of the entire society of Italy. Like the
masks of the Greek comedy, like the rakes and topers of
the English comedy of the Restoration and Revolution,
they are in a certain degree traditional and conventional.
Modern fiction is encyclopædic: no class of the community
is outside its scope. Italian fiction was eclectic,
restricted by a tacit convention to what was deemed its
appropriate sphere. The history of pictorial and plastic
art has been reproduced in modern fiction; the property
of the connoisseur has become the possession of the
nation. Hence, whatever the literary merits of the Italian
novelists of this period, whatever the fidelity with which
they reproduce the social atmosphere of the time, their
works all taken together count for less in the history of
the human mind than those of a single first-class modern
novelist such as Dickens or Balzac.</p>

<p>Boccaccio’s immediate successors as novelists are
F<small>RANCO</small> S<small>ACCHETTI</small> and G<small>IOVANNI</small> F<small>IORENTINO</small>, already
mentioned as poets of the fifteenth century. Sacchetti
(1335-1410) had in his youth been a merchant, and had
travelled much both in Italy and in Slavonian countries.
After his return he became a Florentine magistrate, and
filled some important public offices. He was a man of
solid and humorous wisdom, who instructed his times,
partly by religious and moral discourses, which frequently
display great liberality of feeling, partly by his
stories, which, apart from their literary merits, afford a
valuable picture of a society half-way on the road from
barbarism to civilisation. The majority are founded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
on real occurrences, generally humorous, though the
humour is not always as visible to us as to his contemporaries;
but sometimes tragic. Some, as with
Boccaccio, are derived from folk-lore in the<cite>Gesta
Romanorum</cite> or the<cite>Fabliaux</cite>. All are recounted with
extreme simplicity and brevity. The art of working up
a single incident into a long story by subtle delineation
of character, elaborate description, and ingenious plot
and underplot, was then unknown.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Sacchetti is the
straightforward <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i> and nothing more, but he deserves
as much praise for the ease of his narrative as for
the purity of his style. He can hardly be considered as
an imitator of Boccaccio, who is always the poet and
man of letters, while Sacchetti rather produces the impression
of an ordinary Florentine gentleman telling
stories after dinner with no special care for artistic
effect, which nevertheless he attains by the plain good
sense which bids him go straight to his subject and
subordinate minor details to the really essential. His
tales are single, not set in a framework like Boccaccio’s.</p>


<p>This is not the case with his contemporary Ser Giovanni
Fiorentino, author of the<cite>Pecorone</cite> (<cite>Great Stupid</cite>), who
has exposed himself to ridicule by the quaintness of his
introductory machinery. A friar and a nun are supposed
to meet weekly in the parlour of a convent, and
console themselves for the insuperable obstacles to their
attachment by telling stories, upon the merits of which
they compliment each other extravagantly. The tales,
however, are interesting, well told, and greatly esteemed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>for the excellence of their style. Like Sacchetti’s, they
are mostly genuine anecdotes, or at least founded upon
fact or popular tradition; some are taken with little
alteration from Villani’s Chronicles. Nothing is certainly
known of the author, except that he began to
write his tales in 1378 at the Castle of Dovadola, in
compulsory or voluntary exile from his native city. He
is believed to have been a notary, and a partisan of the
Guelf faction.</p>

<p>Giovanni da Prato, author of<cite>Il Paradin degli Alberti</cite>
(about 1420) also deserves mention here, on account of
the short stories inserted into his ethical dialogues; but
the first novelist of much importance after Giovanni
Fiorentino is M<small>ASSUCCIO</small> of Salerno, a Neapolitan, who
seems to have been a man of rank, and to have been for
some time in the service of the Duke of Milan. He
wrote about 1470, and his tales were first printed in
1476. The celebrity which he continues to enjoy is, it
may be feared, mainly owing to his character as the
most licentious of the Italian novelists in fact, although,
if we may trust his own assurance, the most virtuous in
intention. His tales are divided into five parts, each of
the first three of which has what the writer considers to
be a distinct moral purpose. In the first, in Dunlop’s
words, “the scope of the stories is to show that God will
sooner or later inflict vengeance on dissolute monks.”
The second “proves that the monks of those days invented
many frauds.” The third “is intended to show
that the greatest and finest ladies of Italy indulged in
gallantries of a nature which did them very little honour.”
All these propositions might have been thought susceptible
of demonstration without the<cite>Novellino</cite>, and much
better established than Massuccio’s claim to a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
among moralists or reformers. He protests that his
tales are “ower true,” and for the most part founded on
recent transactions; and, in fact, he appears less indebted
than any predecessor to folk-lore and the French
fabliaux. The last two sections of his work, however,
contain love adventures of too exceptional a nature to
be founded upon actual incidents. Some of these manifest,
not merely ingenuity of invention, but considerable
tragic power. The style is somewhat barbarous; and the
same remark applies to the lighter fiction, generally of
the nature of anecdote, of his contemporary Sabadino
degli Arienti, a native and historian of Bologna. Sabadino’s
tales are much less objectionable than Massuccio’s,
though no less than his in the author’s opinion <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">moralissimi
documenti</i>. They are entitled<cite>Porrettane</cite>, from their
having been composed for the amusement of the visitors
to the baths of Porretta, which gives them some importance
as an index to the taste of the more opulent and
leisured classes of society.</p>

<p>The novels of the following century are exceedingly
numerous, but in general too much upon one pattern
to deserve especial notice until we arrive at those of
Bandello, Cinthio, and Grazzini, each of whom is eminent
for some special characteristic. Of Firenzuola, one of
the most typical writers of his day, we have already
spoken, his novelettes being generally interwoven with
his other prose works. Two single novelettes by separate
authors deserve special notice as world-famous, though
not by the genius of their authors. The<cite>Romeo and
Giulietta</cite> of Luigi da Porto, a gentleman of Vicenza who
died in 1529, is a powerful and well-told story, although
it would have been little heard of but for Shakespeare,
who nevertheless seems to have been unacquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
it, having founded his tragedy upon the inferior version
made by Arthur Brooke after the French of Boistuau.
The other story which has become a portion of the
world’s repertory of fiction is the<cite>Belphegor</cite> of Giovanni
Brevio, a subject also treated by Machiavelli, and revived
in our own day by Thackeray. The idea of the devil’s
aversion to matrimony, not as a divine ordinance, but as
a nuisance inconsistent with his own peace and comfort,
is so irresistibly comic that one is surprised to find it
originally Slavonian.</p>

<p>The celebrity of Pietro Aretino requires the mention
of his novels, which, however, possess no very distinctive
features. To find these we must turn chiefly to Straparola,
whose genre requires a distinct notice; and, among
those who diverged less from the beaten track, Bandello,
Cinthio, and Grazzini. Bandello, says Settembrini,
depicts the Italian, Grazzini the Florentine, Cinthio
humanity at large.</p>

<p>M<small>ATTEO</small> B<small>ANDELLO</small> (1480-1561) was a Lombard and
a Dominican, who resided successively at Mantua and
at Milan, the latter city in his time one of the most
uncomfortable places in Italy from the oppressions and
depredations of the Spanish soldiery. Popular commotions
concurred to drive him to France, where Henry II.
made him Bishop of Agen. His novelettes had been
composed before this distinction befell him, but his
episcopacy was no obstacle to their publication in 1554.
Though frequently licentious, his stories indicate a considerable
advance upon his forerunners in the power of
depicting character and in seriousness of tone. He
prefers historical narration to invention, and usually
bases his tales upon some actual occurrence, often revolting
for its cruelty or indecency. The story of<cite>Violante</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
analysed in No. 380 of the<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, is a good
example of his tragic force, and many others might be
given. The pathetic grace of the opening of his<cite>Gerardo
and Elena</cite>, analysed in the same essay, is no less excellent
in its more romantic and delicate way. He was
a prolific writer, producing no fewer than eighty-nine
novelettes, more esteemed by foreigners than by his own
countrymen, who were offended by his Lombardisms.
Settembrini, however, not in general favourable to the
productions of the Cinque Cento, pronounces him the
first Italian novelist after Boccaccio.</p>

<p>No imputation of rusticity can be attached to the diction
of A<small>NTONIO</small> M<small>ARIA</small> G<small>RAZZINI</small>, surnamed<cite>Il Lasca</cite>
(1503-83), for here the style is the main recommendation
of the work. Grazzini, an apothecary by profession,
was one of the chief promoters of the movement for
prescribing a standard of pure Tuscan, and as one of
the founders of the celebrated Academy <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">degli Umidi</i>,
each of whose members was bound to assume the
name of some fish, he called himself<cite>Il Lasca</cite> (the
Roach), by which name he is best known. Such toys
occupied the thoughts of Italians in an age of decay
when great deeds had become impossible. Grazzini’s
stories are mostly taken from Florentine private life,
and as such have their value, apart from the idiomatic
Tuscan, which is best apprehended by the writer’s countrymen.
They are not of enthralling interest, and when
tragical are sometimes revolting, but the exposition is
easy and artistic.</p>

<p>G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> G<small>IRALDI</small> C<small>INTHIO</small> of Ferrara
(1504-73) is better known by name to English readers
than most of his fellow-novelists, since from him
Shakespeare derived the plots of<cite>Othello</cite> and<cite>Measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
for Measure</cite>. The story on which the former drama is
founded is not a bad specimen of Cinthio’s usual work.
His subjects are frequently tragical, sometimes shocking,
but the treatment is generally powerful, the narrative
direct and forcible, and he is in great measure exempt
from the grossness of his contemporaries. The tales, a
hundred in number, whence their title of<cite>Ecatomithi</cite>,
are supposed to be narrated on board a ship bound for
Marseilles, and conveying a party of Romans escaping
from the sack of the Eternal City. They are divided like
Boccaccio’s into ten classes, each considered to illustrate
some particular point of morals or manners. They are
highly respectable performances; but by so much as
they surpass Grazzini’s in matter they fall below them in
style, which, though not incorrect, is devoid of colour
and individuality.</p>

<p>S<small>TRAPAROLA</small>, already briefly alluded to, was a native
of Caravaggio, and published his<cite>Notti Piacevoli</cite> in 1554.
He is a good story-teller, although a bad stylist; but
what gives him an epoch-making rank among Italian
novelists is not his merit or demerit in either capacity,
but his having been the first to avail himself of popular
folk-lore as a groundwork for fiction. Nothing is more
annoying than the almost complete neglect of popular
mythology by men of culture in antiquity. Apuleius
tells one inimitable tale, without saying where he got it.
Synesius spends his evenings listening to the stories of
the Libyan peasants, and is not at the trouble to preserve
a single one. It is nevertheless clear that such tales
must have been as rife in ancient times as in our own.
Straparola was perhaps the first man who systematically
turned them to literary account: it would have been
well if he had gone much further, and proportionately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
reduced his debt to Hieronymo Morlini, the chief recommendation
of whose generally indecent and always
ungrammatical Latin stories (Naples, 1520) is their exceeding
rarity. Nearly a hundred years afterwards Straparola
was completely eclipsed both as concerned the quantity
and the quality of his folk-lore fictions, by the<cite>Pentamerone</cite>
of G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ASILE</small>, Count of Morone, a collection
whose relation to the popular mythology of other nations
has occasioned endless discussion. Puss in Boots, and
Cinderella, and Rapunzel, and many another favourite
owe to Basile their first appearance in literary costume.
In narrative he is the breathless, loquacious, exuberant
Neapolitan, too much in a hurry to trouble himself
about style or art, but carrying all before him by his
vigour and vehemence, and betraying, as his German
translator has pointed out, strong traces of the influence
of Rabelais.</p>

<p>It will be evident from the above brief sketch of the
Italian novel that in the sixteenth century the art of
novel-writing was nearly identical with the art of narrative.
This was fully possessed by most writers of fiction;
but characterisation, ingenuity of construction and development
of plot, underplot, episode, artful suspension
of interest, above all the application of the novelist’s art
to weighty purposes, were all in the most rudimentary
condition. Compared with the modern novel, the ancient
story is as a simple air upon a flute to the complicated
harmony of an organ. It is true that the old romances
abound with hints and germs only needing development,
but development was slow in coming, and even when
about the beginning of the eighteenth century romance
and novelette had grown into the novel, it was still long
before the novel became a vehicle of ideas and a potent
factor in civilisation. The reason probably is that while
the novel may employ the highest human faculties, it is
at the same time the best medium for conveying ideas to
the less cultivated orders of society. The extension of
reading and writing to these classes has called forth a
tribe of readers which had no existence in the days of
the Cinque Cento, and has invested the only description
of literature which powerfully appeals to them with
extraordinary significance. The influence of the novel
in the modern sense grows, and will continue to grow;
but there is still abundant room for the short and simple
story, the consistent development of a single incident or
situation, compensating in art for what it lacks in variety,
yet, now that human life has become so much richer and
more complex than of old, at a further remove from
mere anecdote than seemed necessary for its Italian
prototype.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>THE DRAMA</small></h2>


<p>Alone among the great nations of the modern world,
Italy stands in the unenviable position of possessing no
drama at the same time national and literary. From
one point of view three classes of the drama may be
distinguished, (1) The rude popular play entirely a
creation of the people, such as the buffooneries of the
Dionysiac festival, out of which the Athenian drama
grew, or the dramatic exhibitions at fairs of itinerant
actors barely distinguishable from mountebanks, like those
whose puppet-plays originated<cite>Faust</cite>. Performances of
this nature have probably existed in every nation endowed
with the rudiments of culture. (2) These crude
beginnings elevated by men of genius into the sphere of
art, and become literary without ceasing to be popular.
This is the true national drama, when the pulses of the
poet and the people beat in full unison, and of which
Greece, England, and Spain have given the world the
most brilliant examples. (3) The artificial drama, written
by men of culture for men of culture, but neglecting, or
at least failing to reach the heart of the people. With the
exception of the musical drama of which Metastasio affords
the type, and of the comedies of Goldoni and Gozzi, all of
which belonged to a more recent period than that with
which we are now engaged, the whole of the Italian drama<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
possessing any literary pretensions belongs to this class.
It is true that, as in England and elsewhere, it is accompanied
by a lower order of dramatic composition which
may be regarded as popular. In the early days of the
Italian drama we have the<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite>, at a later
period the<cite>Commedia dell’ Arte</cite>, of both of which some
notice must be taken. But neither is, strictly speaking,
literature.</p>

<p>It appears at first exceedingly surprising that a nation,
not only so gifted as the Italian, but so dramatically
gifted, should not merely never have achieved a national
drama, but should have no dramatic writer meriting to
be ranked among the chief masters of the art. Lively,
emotional, capable of being worked up to the most
violent degrees of passion; at the same time observant,
sagacious, reflective; members of a society comprising
every variety of character and profession, and inheritors
of a history replete with moving and tragic incidents,
Italians should seem to have wanted no requisite for
the creation of a flourishing stage. Prolific they were
indeed: more than five thousand plays were written
between 1500 and 1734. Perhaps there are not five
which enjoy any considerable reputation out of Italy,
or which, whatever their literary merit, can be considered
characteristically Italian. The most potent of
probable causes will be adduced in its place, but no
single explanation, or any accumulation of partially
satisfactory explanations, will entirely account for so
remarkable a circumstance. One reason was probably
the great development of Italian culture at an early
period, compared with that of other European nations.
The ablest men had become fully acquainted with
Seneca and Terence, and looked upon them as painters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
looked upon Raphael, or sculptors upon Phidias. They
deemed them the norm of excellence, and condemned
themselves to a sterile imitation, which might and
often did possess high literary merit, but which was
entirely estranged from popular sympathies. Men like
Politian and Pontano, who really could have created
a national drama if they could have trusted their own
instincts, were deterred from producing anything at
variance with the canons in which they themselves
believed. It must be said in extenuation of their error,
that the classical school, with all its defects, was vastly
in advance of the rude, amorphous beginnings of the
romantic drama in every country but one. One little
corner of Europe alone possessed in the early sixteenth
century a drama at once living, indigenous, and admirable
as literature. Nothing in literary history is more
surprising than the gap between Gil Vicente and his
contemporaries, whether classical or romantic. Had
he been born an Italian instead of a Portuguese, the
history of the Italian stage might possibly have been
different. It nevertheless remains to be explained why
no such person arose among so gifted a people, and
why throughout their entire history, with one or two
marked exceptions in particular departments, Italians
have never had a drama that they could justly call
their own.</p>

<p>In its first beginnings, notwithstanding, the Italian
drama was as national as any other. As with all other
modern European dramas, its origin was religious. Christianity
found the need of replacing the heathen shows and
spectacles it had suppressed, and amused the people with
representations of Scriptural subjects, or of incidents in
the lives of the saints. For centuries these were never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
written down, but improvised or exhibited in dumb
show. Gradually the miracle-play came into being, a
more advanced development, compelling learning by
rote and much drilling of the performers, and therefore
of necessity committed to writing. In Italy this
assumed a more polished form than elsewhere, the
<cite>Rappresentazione Sacra</cite>, rude in construction, but composed
frequently in elegant, sometimes in excellent octave
verse. This was a development of the fifteenth century,
the earliest of which the date is known being the
<cite>Abraham and Isaac</cite> of Feo Belcari, 1449. It became
exceedingly popular in the later part of the century,
especially at Florence. No less distinguished a person
than Lorenzo de’ Medici is enumerated among its
authors. Numbers of such pieces were printed, down
even to the end of the seventeenth century, and usually
set off with wood-engravings, sometimes of great elegance.
The materials were usually drawn from ecclesiastical
legend. Constantine is represented as giving his
daughter to his successful general Gallicanus, on condition
of his becoming a Christian. Julian, marching
to wage war with the Persians, is slain by an invisible
saint. The histories of Tobit, of St. Agnes, of
St. Cecilia, and numbers of similar legends, form the
staple subjects. Sometimes romance is laid under
contribution, as in the instance of the Emperor Octavian,
but always with a religious motive. Dramatic
force does not seem to have been much considered,
the stately octave being better adapted for declamation
than for dialogue; but the stage directions are
very precise, and every effort seems to have been made
to impress the spectators, so far as permitted by the
rudeness of the open-air theatre, a mere scaffold with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
perhaps a curtain for a background, yet often very
splendidly decorated.</p>

<p>How near Italy came to creating a national drama is
shown by the frequent representations of public events
upon the stage, quite in the spirit of Shakespeare’s
historical plays. Two types may be discriminated&mdash;one
adhering very closely to that of the<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite>, and
composed in the vernacular; the latter following classical
models, and in Latin. To the latter belongs the very
tedious play of Carlo Verardi on the fall of Granada,
performed before Cardinal Riario in 1492; but the very
remarkable and unfortunately lost dramatic chronicle of
the usurpations and downfall of the house of Borgia,
acted before the Duke of Urbino on the recovery of his
states in 1504, seems rather to have belonged to the
former class. To this type also is allied the first Italian
drama of genuine literary merit, the<cite>Orfeo</cite> of Politian,
where the dialogue is mostly in octave stanzas, as in the
<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite>, and the object is evidently rather to
delight the spectators by a rapid succession of scenes
admitting of musical accompaniment than to “purge the
soul by pity and terror.” Slight as this juvenile work of
Politian’s is, it is the work of a poet, and written with
a swing and rush which recall the lyrical parts of the
<cite>Bacchæ</cite> of Euripides. It indicates what the<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite>
might have become but for the competition of the
more classical type of drama, and seems a prelude to
the thoroughly national species of composition which
arose in the seventeenth and prevailed in the eighteenth
century, the opera.</p>

<p>The Italian stage had thus made a respectable beginning
with the drama a hundred years before any drama
worthy of the name existed in England. The disap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>pointment
of such auspicious promise is justly ascribed
by Symonds, in great measure, to the want of a representative
public and a centre of social life. The emulation
of a number of independent cities, so favourable
to the development of art, prevented the development
of the national feeling essential to a national drama.
The political circumstances of these communities, moreover,
were inimical to the existence of a popular stage.
Theatrical representations remained the amusement of
courts; and when the general public was allowed to
participate in them, the play itself was so enveloped in
show and spectacle as to appear the least part of the
entertainment. It was not possible that under such
circumstances the drama could deviate far from conventional
models. Tragedy continued to be composed
after the pattern of Seneca, an imitation of an imitation.
Comedy, though also in bondage to classical precedents,
could not avoid depicting contemporary manners, and
hence displays far more vitality and vigour.</p>

<p>Latin plays had been written by Italians from the
beginning of the fifteenth century, and had included
comedies, now lost, by persons of no less account than
Petrarch and Æneas Sylvius. The first vernacular tragedies
worthy of the name were composed for the entertainment
of the court of Ferrara, and were written in the
octave stanza or<cite>terza rima</cite>. No genius could have
adapted this form to the exigencies of the stage, and a
great step was taken when in 1515 Trissino, whose epic
on the Gothic wars has been previously noticed, wrote his
tragedy of<cite>Sophonisba</cite> in blank verse, retaining nothing
of the lyrical element but the chorus. The piece marks
an era, and as such remains celebrated, notwithstanding
its total want of poetry and passion. It would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
been a good outline for an abler hand to have clothed
with substance. Trissino had abundance of successors
and imitators, most of whom had more poetical endowment,
but few more genuine vocation, and all of whom
are devoid of any impulse except the ambition of literary
distinction. This could only be reached by the prescribed
path; and no vestige of originality appears in any
of them except Sperone Speroni’s innovation, not laudable
in a tragedy, although a fruitful suggestion for the
pastoral drama, of mingling lyrical metres with the regulation
blank verse. The subject of his play, the incest
of Macareus and Canace, infinitely overtaxed his elegant
talent. Of the other tragedies of the time, the best
known are the<cite>Rosmunda</cite> of Rucellai, the<cite>Mariamne</cite> of
Lodovico Dolce, and the<cite>Orbecche</cite> of Cinthio the novelist,
whose<cite>Epitia</cite> contains the rude germ of Shakespeare’s
<cite>Measure for Measure</cite><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. At a later date tragedy was attempted
by a true poet of great genius, who would
assuredly have produced something memorable under
favourable circumstances. Hut the composition of
Tasso’s<cite>Torrismondo</cite>, commenced in his youth, was
long interrupted, and the play was completed in 1586
under the depressing circumstances of his Mantuan exile.
It thus wants energy; and, as Carducci remarks, Tasso is
too much of an eclectic, striving by a combination of the
advantages of all styles to supply the one indispensable
gift of poetical inspiration, which misfortune had all but
extinguished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span></p>
<p>The first Italian comedies, like the tragedies, were
written in rhyme. One early example is entitled to
notice, both on account of the subject and as the work
of an excellent poet, the<cite>Timone</cite> of Boiardo. It is little
more than a translation of Lucian’s Dialogue, yet was,
we feel confident, the channel through which Shakespeare
gained the acquaintance with that work revealed
in his<cite>Timon of Athens</cite>. The history of Italian comedy
as a recognised form of art should, however, be dated
from the<cite>Calandra</cite> of Cardinal Bibbiena, first performed
about 1508. It hardly attempts delineation of character,
but, as Symonds remarks, “achieved immediate success
by reproducing both the humour of Boccaccio and the
invention of Plautus in the wittiest vernacular.” The
plot is taken from the<cite>Menæchmi</cite> of Plautus, the source
of Shakespeare’s<cite>Comedy of Errors</cite>; but Bibbiena’s idea
of making the indistinguishable twins brother and sister
enhances the comic effect at the expense of morality,
little considered by cardinals in those days.</p>

<p>The great success of Bibbiena’s comedy was calculated
to encourage rivalry, and it chanced that two of the first
men in Italy of the day possessed the dramatic instinct,
combined with a decided gift for satire. In the year following
the exhibition of the<cite>Calandra</cite> (1509), Ariosto gave
the<cite>Cassaria</cite>, a comedy of intrigue on the Plautine model.
The same description is applicable to his other comedies,
the<cite>Suppositi</cite>, the<cite>Lena</cite>, the<cite>Negromante</cite>, and the<cite>Scolastica</cite>.
In all except the<cite>Negromante</cite> the action turns upon
the stratagems of a knavish servant to obtain for his
master the money indispensable for the gratification of
his amorous desires. This style of comedy requires a
well-contrived plot, and the maintenance of the interest
throughout by a series of ingenious surprises and un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>foreseen
incidents. In these Ariosto fully attains his
object. Writing for the amusement of a court, he does
not care to stray from the conventions which he knows
will satisfy, and his pieces afford no measure of the
success he might have attained if he had appealed to
the public and essayed to depict Italian society as it
existed. One of the characters is exceedingly lifelike,
the accommodating Dominican in the<cite>Scolastica</cite>, who,
armed with all imaginable faculties from the Pope, is
ready to commute the fulfilment of an inconvenient vow
into the performance of some good work profitable to
his order. This play was left unfinished, but was written
before the<cite>Lena</cite> and the<cite>Negromante</cite>, which probably
appeared about 1528.</p>

<p>The other Italian comic writer of genius was one of
more powerful intellect and more serious character than
Ariosto, if less richly endowed as a poet. Released from
prison after the overthrow of his party and the loss of
his political position in 1512, Machiavelli found solace in
the composition of the<cite>Mandragola</cite> (<cite>Mandrake</cite>), a piece
acted before the Pope in that day, and which could
hardly be represented anywhere in this. Its cynicism is
worse than its immorality, the plot consisting in the
stratagem by which an innocent young wife is persuaded
to admit a lover; all the personages, including
the husband, who is nevertheless himself deceived in a
material point, co-operating for so laudable an end.
Disagreeable as the situation is, it is probably founded
upon fact; and at all events the play is no pale copy of
Plautus or Terence, but full of consistent and strongly
individualised characters, and scenes of the most drastically
comic effect. The portrait of the rascally father
confessor is particularly vigorous, and proves of itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
how ripe the times were for Luther. A dozen more
plays of equal merit would have raised the Italian stage
very high. But no successor to Machiavelli appeared;
and his other play, the<cite>Clizia</cite>, is deficient in originality,
being little more than a paraphrase of the<cite>Casina</cite> of
Plautus.</p>

<p>Many comedies of considerable merit succeeded
Machiavelli’s, among which may be particularly mentioned
those of Firenzuola, who followed Roman precedents,
and of Cecchi, and Gelli, and Grazzini, who to a
considerable extent disengaged themselves from tradition.
Angelo Beolco, called<cite>Il Ruzzante</cite>, struck upon a
new vein in the delineation of rustic life, involving the
employment of dialect; and, near the end of the century,
the life of the people was represented with extreme
vividness by Buonarotti, nephew of Michael Angelo, in
his<cite>Fiera</cite> and<cite>Tancia</cite>. One other comic dramatist takes
an important place, the repulsive and decried Aretino.
His claim to permanent significance is grounded, not
on the scanty literary merits of his works, but on
the unique characteristic thus expressed by Symonds,
“They depict the great world from the standpoint of the
servants’ hall.” They are the work of a low-minded
man, who could see nothing but the baser traits of the
society around him, but saw these clearly, and also saw
no reason why he should not blazon what he saw.
Hence his usefulness is in the ratio of his offensiveness.</p>

<p>It is significant of the difference between the Italian
mind and the Spanish, and of the extent to which the
former had emancipated itself from mediævalism, that
the<cite>Rappresentazione</cite>, touching so nearly on the confines
of the Spanish<cite>Auto</cite>, never developed into that or any
allied variety of the drama. The abstractions of the vices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
and virtues, so natural to the Spaniard and the man of
the Middle Age in general, were uncongenial to the
Italian, whose<cite>Rappresentazioni</cite> were always peopled by
definite, tangible persons, even if of the spiritual order.
The<cite>Adamo</cite> of Andreini, early in the seventeenth century,
from which Milton undoubtedly derived his first
idea of treating the Fall in a miracle play, might have
led to a development in this direction, but remained an
isolated eccentricity. The true national development lay
in quite another path, the pastoral drama. Something
like this might be found in Gil Vicente, but we may be
certain that his works were totally unknown in Italy, and
that the pastoral play grew out of such romances as the
Arcadia, such eclogues as those of Baptista Mantuanus,
and the court masques in which the principal parts were
taken by shepherds and shepherdesses. Politian’s<cite>Orfeo</cite>
is not very far from being such a piece, although it is a
good deal more. A pastoral masque was composed as
early as 1506 by Castiglione for the amusement of the
court of Urbino. Others followed from time to time,
and developed into a real pastoral drama by Beccari in
1554; but the literary pretensions of this class of composition
continued to be very slender until it was virtually
created by Tasso’s<cite>Aminta</cite> in 1573. Few novel experiments
in literature have enjoyed a more immediate
or more permanent success. Numerous as were the
<cite>Aminta’s</cite> imitators, its primacy has never but once been
seriously challenged, and its nature and simplicity have
in general been justly preferred to the more elaborate
artifice of the<cite>Pastor Fido</cite>. It is indeed deficient in the
rich poetry of its English rival, the<cite>Faithful Shepherdess</cite>,
“as inferior, poetically speaking,” says Leigh Hunt, “as
a lawn with a few trees on it is to the depths of a forest.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
But Leigh Hunt confesses its superiority in “true dramatic
skill, and flesh and blood interest”: it is indeed as
far as anything can be from the insipidity usually associated
with pastoral compositions. It has, moreover,
more of the genuine yearning for the golden age, the
spirit which inspires Keats’s<cite>Endymion</cite>, than is found
in the fanciful dramas of Fletcher, or Milton, or Ben
Jonson. “The central motive of<cite>Aminta</cite> and the
<cite>Pastor Fido</cite>,” says Symonds, “is the contrast between
the actual world of ambition, treachery, and sordid
strife, and the ideal world of pleasure, loyalty, and
tranquil ease.”</p>

<p>Although the pastoral drama is a legitimate as well as
a beautiful kind of composition, it is not capable of very
great extension or variety. Tasso’s successors might
conceivably surpass him as poets, but could only repeat
him as dramatists. His only serious competitor is his
contemporary G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> G<small>UARINI</small>, the author
of the<cite>Pastor Fido</cite> (1537-1612).</p>

<p>Guarini, the descendant of a Veronese family already
distinguished in letters, was, like Tasso, attached to the
court of the Duke of Ferrara; but, unlike Tasso, was a
man of the world, and was employed in several important
missions, especially one to solicit the crown of Poland
for his master, where he nearly died of a Polish inn.
Like most of the Duke’s literary protégés, he became
estranged from him, and spent the later part of his life
in roaming from court to court in quest of employment,
and litigating with his children and the world at large.
His disposition was quarrelsome; literary disputes had
long severed him from Tasso; it is to his honour that
when the latter was unable to watch over his own works,
he took care of and published his lyrical poems. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
most brilliant episode of Guarini’s life was the publication
of his<cite>Pastor Fido</cite> in 1590; but not the least troublesome
was the literary controversy in which it involved him.
These disputes, born rather of the idleness than of the
conscientiousness of the Italian literati, are now forgotten,
and the<cite>Pastor Fido</cite>, a direct challenge to the
<cite>Aminta</cite>, is allowed an honourable though a second place.
Its relation to its predecessor may be compared to that
of the Corinthian order to the Ionic. Guarini has sought
to compensate for the lack of natural, spontaneous inspiration
by superior artifice of plot: his characters are
more numerous, and his action more intricate and ingenious.
This would not have availed him much if he
had not been a poet, but this he certainly was, though
with less of the<cite>nascitur</cite> and more of the<cite>fit</cite> than usual.
Tasso was conscious of a truer inspiration, and conveys
his claim to the virtual invention of a new mode in
poetry in the verses which he has placed in the mouth
of Love appearing in the disguise of a shepherd, thus
rendered by Leigh Hunt:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><cite>After new fashion shall these woods to-day<br />
Hear love discoursed; and it shall well be seen<br />
That my divinity is present here<br />
In its own person, not its ministers.<br />
I will inbreathe high fancies in rude hearts;<br />
I will refine, and render dulcet sweet,<br />
Their tongues; because, wherever I may be,<br />
Whether with rustic or heroic men,<br />
There am I Love; and inequality,<br />
As it may please me, I do equalise;<br />
And ’tis my crowning glory and great miracle<br />
To make the rustic pipe as eloquent<br />
Even as the subtlest harp.</cite></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Guarini frequently repeated Tasso’s ideas, striving to
enhance their effect by careful elaboration. The poetry
of one or both has passed into Calderon’s<cite>Magico Prodigioso</cite>,
and originated the scene of the temptation of
Justina, an ornament of English literature in the incomparable
version of Shelley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>TASSO</small></h2>


<p>The year 1564 is memorable in the intellectual history
of the world. It marks the beginning of the long
ascent of the North, and of the slow depression of
the South. In it Shakespeare was born; in it Michael
Angelo died; in it the decrees of the Council of
Trent were promulgated by one of the most liberal
and enlightened of the Popes, even as the Society of
Jesus had been established twenty-four years before by
another entitled to the same commendation. Neither
Paul nor Pius was free to gratify his personal inclinations
at the expense of the institution over which
he presided; and in fact the Society and the Council
were less important in themselves than as indicative
of the new spirit which was to prevail in Roman
Catholic countries, destructive, so far as its influence
extended, of science, and deadly to learning, literature,
and art. The time was at hand when the policy
of great states was to be controlled by confessors;
when the clergy, under the influence of a training in
special seminaries, were to be converted from an order
into a caste; when the entire influence of State and
Church was to be devoted to the repression of free
thought, with the inevitable result of intellectual degeneracy,
and mortifying inferiority to the nations which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
with whatever limitations, acknowledged the principle of
freedom.</p>

<p>From this period Italian literature, though still interesting
in itself, becomes comparatively unimportant
in its relation to general civilisation; it drops from the
first place into the third, and every year widens the
interval between the retrogressive and the progressive
peoples. The results of eighty years of oppression are
thus stated by an illustrious visitor on the authority
of the Italians themselves: “I have sate among their
learned men,” says Milton, “and been counted happy
to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom as
they supposed England was, while they themselves did
nothing but bemoan the servile condition into which
learning among them was brought, that this was it which
had damped the glory of Italian wits; that nothing had
been written there now these many years but flattery and
fustian.” These, it will be observed, are not Milton’s own
words, but report the views of the cultivated Italians with
whom he associated, and who, enslaved but not subdued,
still nurtured hopes which our times have seen
fulfilled. Could the foreigner have been excluded, could
men like these have been left to settle by themselves with
priest and prince, it is probable that the anti-Renaissance
reaction and the counter-Reformation would never have
come to pass. Yet Italy cannot be wholly excused; the
foreigner had brought the mischief, but who had brought
the foreigner?</p>

<p>This age of decadence is nevertheless represented to
posterity by one of the greatest poets of Italy; nor can
his misfortunes be specially charged upon it. The sad
story of T<small>ORQUATO</small> T<small>ASSO</small> has ever excited and ever must
excite the deepest compassion; but it is not now believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
that any fellow-mortal was responsible for his sorrows,
or that they were materially aggravated by ill-usage from
any quarter. The simple fact is that during the later
part of his life Tasso was frequently either insane or on
the borderland between sanity and insanity, and that,
given his peculiar mental constitution, his double portion
of the morbid irritability and sensitiveness commonly
incidental to the poetical temperament, the same affliction
must have befallen him under any circumstances or
in any age of the world. It is indeed possible that his
brain was in some measure clouded and warped by the
unnatural discipline of the Jesuits into whose hands he
fell in his boyhood, and that this determined the nature
of some of the symptoms of mental alienation which he
afterwards manifested. It was, moreover, his great misfortune
that his age should have afforded no other sphere
for a delicate and candid mind than a court honeycombed
with intrigue and jealousy. Yet the fate of so
morbidly sensitive a spirit could hardly have been materially
different; it is only wonderful that he should
have regained so much of his intellect and died master
of himself. Courtly society and religious excitement
between them admirably trained his magnificent genius
to write the<cite>Jerusalem Delivered</cite>, in its relation to general
culture the epic of the Roman Catholic revival, but, from
the large-hearted humanity of the author, happily much
more.</p>

<p>The circumstances of Tasso’s youth were such as to
intensify the innate melancholy of his disposition. His
father Bernardo, whom we have met with as a poet and
a high-minded cavalier, ruined himself and his family
within a few years after Torquato’s birth at Sorrento
(1544) by the noble imprudence of the advice which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
gave to his Neapolitan patron, and, though afterwards
the servant of princes, died in poverty. When twelve
years old Tasso lost his mother, poisoned, as was
thought, by her relatives, to rob her husband of her
portion. We have spoken of the Jesuitry which marred
his early education; afterwards, however, he was brought
up in a much saner manner. At Urbino, where his
father found a temporary refuge, afterwards in busy
Venice and at Padua, where he ineffectually studied law,
he had become a master of classics, mathematics, and
philosophy, and had not only read but annotated Dante.
By the time (1565) when he became attached to the
court of Ferrara, he had published his<cite>Rinaldo</cite>, in form
an imitation of Ariosto, but indicative of a new spirit;
and had less fortunately signalised the termination of a
two years’ residence at Bologna by a scrape in which
he had involved himself by reciting a pasquinade upon
the university, which not unnaturally caused him to be
accused of having written it. This adventure at least
evinced serious deficiency in tact&mdash;an endowment more
essential than genius in the situation where he now
found himself.</p>

<p>Tasso’s immediate obligations at the court of Ferrara
were to Luigi, Cardinal d’Este, brother of the Duke, who
seems to have expected nothing from him but duteous
attendance, and the completion of the great poem of
which the<cite>Rinaldo</cite> had given promise, and whose theme
was still unfixed. Nothing appears to the Cardinal’s
disadvantage; nor is any especial reproach addressed to
his high-spirited brother the Duke, except the heavy
taxation he imposed to maintain a magnificence disproportioned
to his revenue. The two great ladies of the
court, the Duke’s sisters, were decidedly sympathetic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
and there seems no reason to attribute malevolence to
his fellow-courtiers. The situation of this child of genius
at a court was indeed a false one, and could have no
fortunate issue; yet the innate germ of insanity would
almost certainly have developed itself, whatever the external
circumstances of his lot. For five or six years all
went well. Tasso chose the subject of his poem,
laboured diligently at it, attracted universal admiration
by the brilliancy and fluency of his occasional compositions,
disputed successfully with the élite of Ferrara on
the subject of Love, and in 1571 accompanied the Cardinal
on a mission to France. The French court had
not yet resolved upon the St. Bartholomew, and its
coquettings with the Huguenots scandalised the devout
poet. He composed two discourses upon France and
its affairs, which, although in some respects fanciful, display
much penetration. On his return he quitted the
Cardinal’s service for no very apparent reason, and
shortly afterwards entered the Duke’s. This would
bring him into more intimate relations with the Duke’s
sisters. One of these, Lucrezia, soon contracted, avowedly
for reasons of state, a marriage with the Duke
of Urbino; but Leonora, weak in health and devoted
to good works, remained single. With her the romance
of Tasso’s life is associated; and although the
belief that a presumptuous attachment occasioned his
imprisonment is undoubtedly groundless, the attachment
itself is the evident inspiration of much of his
lyrical poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

<p>Such verses are too deeply felt for mere compliment,
and, if sincere, could only be addressed to some one
much above himself in station. In another sonnet a
consciousness of presumption is clearly indicated:</p>

<p class="p1">Neither Tasso nor Leonora, however, was of an amorous
temperament; and there is no reason to suppose that he
experienced any great difficulty in keeping his passion
within Platonic bounds. The hidden flame may well
have wrought him to the production of his unsurpassed
<cite>Aminta</cite> in 1572-73. But in 1574 a severe illness marks
an era in his life; he is never again quite the same man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
In 1575 we encounter the first decided symptoms of an
unsettled mind in querulousness and morbid suspicion,
augmented, we may well believe, by the vexations attendant
upon the revision of his now completed epic.
He thought, and with justice, that he had written a
truly religious poem, and he now found the ecclesiastical
reaction demanding by the mouth of Silvio
Antoniano, a type of the Roman Catholic Puritan of
that ungenial day, that it should be adapted to the
reading of monks and nuns. Solerti, his chief modern
biographer, seems inclined to consider “his two years’
warfare with bigotry and pedantry” the principal cause
of his insanity; Carducci rather accuses his Jesuit education.
Both were actual causes, more potent and
malignant than his sentimental attachment to Leonora;
but in truth the germ of insanity had always been latent
in his brain, and the special occasion of its manifestation
was comparatively immaterial.</p>

<p>Happily, as Settembrini justly distinguishes, it was
not obscuration or decay, but exalted tension of the
mind, and left the power of thinking and writing
almost unimpaired, except under the influence of
violent paroxysm. The disorder assumed the special
form of morbid suspicion, a constant dread of inimical
machinations, and self-accusation of imaginary heresies.
He fled from Ferrara only to return; and at length
(July 1579) a frenzied attack upon a retainer of the court
necessitated his confinement as a lunatic. He would
not have been subjected to the indignity of chains in our
day, but the psychiatry of that age knew no better, and
the best proof that its methods were not utterly perverse
is the speedy restoration of his reason in a much greater
measure than could have been hoped. At first he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
unquestionably maniacal; but his state gradually became
one of apparent sanity infested by delusions, to which
many of the painful particulars alleged in his letters are
to be ascribed. One prevailing hallucination was the
frequent visitation of a familiar spirit, with whom he held
long dialogues. His treatment improved with his mental
condition; though sometimes, by the inattention of his
custodians, as we must think, short of necessary food, he
had comfortable apartments, was allowed to carry on an
extensive and apparently uncontrolled correspondence,
and produced enough excellent work, chiefly prose dialogues,
to prove at least the enjoyment of numerous lucid
intervals. At length, in July 1586, he was permitted to
retire to Mantua. Alphonso appears to have behaved
becomingly to the poet, considered merely as an unhappy
vassal: it is no special reproach to him to have
been neither an Alexander the Great nor a Wolfe to
rightly appraise the comparative worth of the<cite>Jerusalem
Delivered</cite> and the ducal crown of Ferrara.</p>

<p>The remainder of Tasso’s life was spent in restless
wanderings to and fro between courts and cities, like
the tossings of a sick man who vainly seeks ease by
shifting his position upon his couch. He could not
live without a patron, and no patron long contented
him. It would be tedious to tell how often he forsook
and resought Mantua, Florence, Rome, Naples; he even
made overtures of reconciliation to Ferrara. It was not
his fault, but sheer mental infirmity, by which, however,
his reason, though frequently obscured or misled, was
never again overthrown. At Naples his friend Manso
heard a profound argument between him and his familiar
spirit; both voices were his own, but of this Tasso
was unconscious. He had completed and published his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
tragedy,<cite>Torrismondo</cite>, at Mantua in 1586; at Naples the
exhortations of Manso’s mother led him to compose his
blank-verse poem on the Week of Creation (<cite>Il Mondo
Creato</cite>), chiefly remarkable for its evident influence on
the style and versification of Milton. The latter books,
written in sickness, evince some languor, but no symptoms
of disordered faculties appear, although the servility
of the pseudo-religious sentiment painfully evinces
how much ecclesiastical influences had enslaved him,
and how he had fallen away from the free spirit of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>Another work of Tasso’s decline, the reconstruction
of the<cite>Jerusalem Delivered</cite> under the title of the<cite>Conquest
of Jerusalem</cite>, although an error of judgment, yet
rather indicates undue sensitiveness to criticism than
insanity. Imperfect as the first editions had been, the
<cite>Jerusalem</cite> had been received with enthusiasm, but had
also excited much pedantic and some bigoted censure.
The general result had been to convince Tasso that his
poem was too romantic and not sufficiently epical;
which, abstractedly considered, was true, but simply
arose from the fact that his genius was rather romantic
than epic. In endeavouring to bring his poem nearer
Homer he led it away from Nature, and the beauties
which he introduced bore no proportion to those which
he retrenched. The new recension fell entirely flat, and
is now almost unknown; although had the<cite>Jerusalem
Delivered</cite> never been published, the<cite>Conquest</cite> would undoubtedly
have gained Tasso a considerable name. It
was dedicated to a new patron, Cardinal Cinthio Aldobrandini,
nephew of Pope Clement VIII., and all allusions
to the house of Este, for whose heritage the Pope,
“hushed in grim repose,” was patiently waiting, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
carefully expunged. Cinthio proved a kind and considerate
patron; and Clement, who was endowed with a
regal instinct for doing the right thing at the right time,
was on the point of honouring Tasso with a public coronation
after the example of Petrarch, when on April 25,
1595, death removed him from earthly honours and indignities
in the convent of San Onofrio, where he had
for some time found an asylum, and where the crown
which should have arrayed his temples was placed upon
his bier.</p>

<p>Apart from the failings without which he would hardly
have been a poet, and the infirmities for which it would
be unjust to make him responsible, Tasso’s deportment
throughout life was that of an amiable, high-minded,
and accomplished gentleman. Two defects alone produce
a painful impression&mdash;the entire lack of any sense
of humour, and the apparent indifference to all public
interests outside of court and ecclesiastical life. The
former of these was congenital, irremediable, and bitterly
expiated by the undignified predicaments in which it involved
him; the latter would not have existed if he had
lived in a better age. He did, indeed, like Spenser and
Tennyson, attribute a didactic and allegorical purpose to
his poem which may have been patent to his own mind,
but with which no reader, if not a commentator also, ever
concerned himself. Yet the significance of the<cite>Jerusalem
Delivered</cite> does not solely consist in the beauty of the language
and the exquisiteness of the characters: although
an artificial, it is in some sense a national epic. Thanks
mainly to the pressure of foreign tyrants, Protestantism
and the Renaissance both had for the time been crushed
in Italy, and the Italian poet who would be national must
write in the spirit of the reaction. Catholicism was put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>ting
forth its utmost strength to drive back the Ottoman
and the heretic; and although, when Tasso began his
<cite>Jerusalem</cite>, he could have foreseen neither Lepanto nor
the St. Bartholomew, it is a remarkable instance of the
harmony which pervades all human affairs, that both
should have happened ere he had completed it. Had
either been the subject of his poem, the result would
have been utter failure; but the great theme of the
Crusades exhibits the dominant thought of his own
day exalted to a commanding elevation, set at an awful
distance, and purged of all contemporary littleness;
transfigured in the radiance of poetry and history. A
nobler subject for epic song could not well be found,
save for the defect which it shares with almost all
epics which have been created by study and reflection,
and have not, like the<cite>Iliad</cite>, grown spontaneously
out of the heart and mind of a great people. The
principal action is insufficient for the poem, and needs
to be eked out and adorned by copious episodes.
The<cite>Æneid</cite> would present a poor figure without the
burning of Troy, the death of Dido, and Æneas’s
descent to the shades; the<cite>Jerusalem</cite> is still more
indebted to Clorinda and Armida, and the embellishment
is still more loosely connected with the poem’s
ostensible purpose. Tasso’s genius was in many respects
truly epical; yet, the nearer he approaches lyric
or pastoral, the more thoroughly he seems at home.
That his Saracens should be more interesting than his
Christians, and his Christians most interesting when
least Christian, was perhaps inevitable. It is a proof of
the essential excellence of human nature that, unless
in very extreme cases, its sympathies are always most
readily enlisted by the weaker side. Homer himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
could not avoid making Hector more attractive than
Achilles. Another defect lay less in the nature of things
than in the spirit of the age, the occasional anticipation
of the false taste of the seventeenth century. Italy was
weary of the elegant exteriors and empty interiors of the
compositions of Bembo and Molza. A Wordsworth,
arising to proclaim a return to nature, might have endowed
her with a new age of great literature, but the
circumstances of the time absolutely forbade any such
apparition, and the craving for vitality and vigour had
to be appeased by a show of intellectual dexterity and
mere exaggeration. Tasso betrays just enough of the premonitory
symptoms of this literary plague to call down
the wrath of Boileau, whose outrageous denunciation has
been remembered where measured reproof would have
been forgotten.</p>

<p>When all has been said that can be said, the<cite>Jerusalem
Delivered</cite> remains a very great poem, the greatest of
all the artificial epics after the<cite>Æneid</cite> and<cite>Paradise
Lost</cite> (for Ariosto’s poem, so frequently paralleled
with it, is not an epic at all). That Tasso should
approach Virgil more nearly than any other poet is
perhaps unfortunate for him; the<cite>Jerusalem</cite> and the
<cite>Æneid</cite> constantly admit of comparison, and wherever
comparison is possible the former is a little behind.
To compare Tasso with Milton seems almost profanation;
and indeed, if, as so often assumed, the greatness
of an epic poet is to be measured by his sublimity,
the<cite>Jerusalem</cite> is entirely out of the field. Milton
is the sublimest of non-dramatic poets after Homer:
Tasso, always dignified and sometimes grand, rarely
attains sublimity, and falls particularly short of it in the
description of the infernal council, where comparison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
with Milton is most obvious. Yet he has advantages
which it would be unjust to deny. He has not, like
Milton, proposed to himself an unattainable object: he
has not to justify the ways of God to man, but to recount
the conquest of Jerusalem. He is more uniform in
merit: it cannot be said of his poem that the catastrophe
takes place in the middle, and that the interest steadily
declines thenceforth.</p>

<p>What, however, especially distinguishes Tasso, not
only from Milton, but from modern epic poets in
general, is the number and excellence of his characters,
mostly of his own creation. Rinaldo, Tancred,
Argante, Emireno, Solimano, Clorinda, Armida, Erminia,
form a gallery of portraits whose picturesqueness and
variety redeem Tasso’s inferiority in other respects;
while at the same time, even were his canvas less brilliantly
occupied, it could not be said that his poem
wanted either the unity, the interest, the dignity, the
just proportion, the poetical spirit, the elevated diction,
or the harmonious versification essential to a
great epic. The great defect of the poem, regarded
as an epic, is that Tasso’s bent, like Virgil’s, was
rather towards the pathetic, the picturesque, and the
romantic, than towards the sublime and majestic.
He can command dignity and grandeur on occasion;
but, even as the<cite>Æneid</cite> opens most readily at
Dido, Marcellus, or Euryalus, so the<cite>Jerusalem</cite> attracts
most by its female characters, Erminia, Clorinda, and
Armida. Armida is a charming personage, an improvement
upon the Alcina of Ariosto, but a passage
like the following, rendered by Miss Ellen Clerke,
would be more appropriately placed in an<cite>Orlando</cite> or
an<cite>Odyssey</cite> than in an epic on so high and grave a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
theme as the redemption of the holy city from the
unbeliever:</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">Few of the great artificial epics of the world, those
which have not been moulded out of songs and legends
welling up spontaneously from the heart of the people,
can sustain very strict criticism of their poetical economy,
and the <em>Jerusalem Delivered</em> perhaps less than any
other. The subject of the Crusades, indeed, is a very
great one, too vast even to be embraced in a single
poem; and the capture of Jerusalem, though of all its
incidents incomparably the most fit for poetical treatment,
is not of itself sufficiently extensive for an epic
poem. It must consequently be enriched by episodes,
which in Tasso’s hands have the double fault of jarring
with the spirit of the main action, and of obscuring its
due predominance by their superior attractiveness. It
might perhaps have been otherwise if Tasso had been
cast in the mould of Milton or had lived in an austerer
age. Italian poetry, however, was so saturated by the influence
of Petrarch and Ariosto that any embellishments
of the chief action must of necessity partake of the character
of love and romance. The former class, however
charming in themselves, inevitably depressed the character
of an epic so largely depending upon them as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
<em>Jerusalem</em>, below that proper to an heroic poem. The
romance and sorcery, though recommended to Tasso
as introducing the supernatural, then considered indispensable
to epic poetry, provoke criticism by their inconsistency.
If the enchanters Ismeno and Armida could
do so much, they might have done a great deal more.
Ismeno has all the infernal hosts at his command, and
makes hardly any use of them. Pluto is a most lazy and
incompetent devil. Armida might easily have made her
magic island impregnable. The whole contrivance of
the enchanted wood, though full of descriptive beauties,
is weak as poetical machinery; it could have offered no
real obstacle to the Christians. And it is almost comical
to observe that amid all the confusion the venerable Peter
the Hermit knows perfectly well what is to happen, can
remedy every misfortune when he chooses, and could
have prevented it but for the convenience of the poet,
more inexorable than the fiat of the Fates.</p>

<p>The merit of the <em>Jerusalem</em>, then, consists mainly in
details whose beauty requires no exposition. Mention
has already been made of the merit of the character-painting,
which greatly surpasses Ariosto’s. The latter’s
personages are in comparison puppets; Tasso’s are living
men and women. The passion of love in the three principal
female characters is exquisitely painted, and admirably
discriminated in accordance with the disposition of
each. Erminia, in particular, calls up the sweetest image
conceivable of womanly tenderness and devotion. Rinaldo
is less interesting than he should have been; but Tancred
is the mirror of chivalry; and the difficulty of delineating
a perfect hero without provoking scepticism or disgust
is overcome as nearly as possible in the character of
Goffredo. The veteran Raimondo’s insistence upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
post of honour and danger; the indomitable spirit of
Solimano; the circumspect valour of Emireno, devoid
of illusion, and with no aim but the fulfilment of duty&mdash;are
noble traits, and the more so as the poet found them
in himself. The very last incident in the poem, Goffredo’s
interference to save his gallant enemy Altamoro, is one
that could have occurred to no one less noble and
courteous than the author of the <em>Jerusalem</em>. It is very
different from Bradamante’s behaviour to Atlante in the
<em>Orlando Furioso</em>.</p>

<p>Another honourable characteristic is Tasso’s love of
science and discovery, revealed by many passages in
his minor poems and his dialogues, and in the <em>Jerusalem</em>
by the noble prophecy of the Columbus to be. His
sonnet to Stigliani, hereafter to be quoted, appears to
hint that with better health and fortune he would himself
have taken the exploits of Columbus as the subject of
another epic; and he is said to have remarked that the
only contemporary poet against whom he felt any hesitation
in measuring himself was Camoens, the singer of the
discoveries of the Portuguese. This theme, often essayed,
and never with success, would have favoured Tasso’s
genius in so far as it exempted him from describing
single combats and pitched battles. His battle-pieces
are not ineffective, but he is evidently more at home
among the sorceries of Armida’s enchanted garden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>“Ah mark!” he sang, “the rose but now revealed,<br />
Fresh from its veiling sheath of virgin green,<br />
Unfolded yet but half, half yet concealed,<br />

All faded now, as though it ne’er had been<br />
The beauteous growth, that while it bloomed retired,<br />
A thousand maids, a thousand youths desired.</em></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>

<p class="p1"><em>“Thus passeth in the passing of a day<br />
Life’s flower, with green and roseate tints imbued:<br />
Think not, since Spring leads back the laughing May,<br />
The mortal bloom shall likewise be renewed.<br />

Dims the fair vault, and cloud and gloom intrude.<br />
Cull we Love’s roses in the hour approved,<br />
When whoso loves may hope to be beloved.”</em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>He ceased, and with one voice the feathered choir,<br />

In rugged oaks, light foliage flutters fain;<br />
And earth and ocean seem to throb and move<br />
With softest sense and sweetest sighs of Love.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The alterations introduced by Tasso when he remodelled
his epic amount to an admission of the justice
of the charges brought against him, of having deviated
too much into picturesque episodes, and been, in short,
too lyrical. It might therefore have been expected that
he would have taken a supreme place in lyrical poetry,
and the anticipation would have been confirmed by the
triumph of his <em>Aminta</em>. It is not entirely justified by
his other lyrical performances; few of his numerous
canzoni and multitudinous sonnets being absolutely in
the front rank. The cause is probably want of concentration;
he was always ready with a sonnet at call,
and composed far too many upon petty and trivial occasions.
His best lyrics, nevertheless, have a property which
no other Italian poetry possesses in like measure&mdash;a certain
majestic vehemence, like that of a mighty river, or
what Shakespeare describes as “the proud full sail of his
great verse.” It has even been argued, mainly on the
strength of “that affable familiar ghost,” that Tasso was
the rival of whom Shakespeare complains; however this
may be, no description could better express the peculiarity
of his lyrical style. The manner, unfortunately, is
often far in advance of the matter. There is no more
splendid example, for instance, than his “Coronal”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of
sonnets, where a sonority and impetuosity that might
have celebrated the battle of Lepanto are squandered
upon the house of Este. The same qualities, however,
are always present when his feelings are deeply moved,
as when he accompanies in thought his lady to the verge
of the sea:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>THE PROSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>The seventeenth century is for Italy a period of stagnation,
relieved only by the endeavour to conceal decay by fantastic
extravagance, by a fortunate reaction near its termination,
and by some genuine progress in isolated directions,
which would have been fruitful of important results in a
better age. The false taste which disfigured the epoch
was not peculiar to Italy; but while in other countries it
appears a symptom of exuberant life, a disorder incident
to infancy, in Italy it dominates literature, some departments
of practical knowledge and study excepted. What
elsewhere was boisterous youth, was in Italy premature
old age. No other cause for this decadence can be
assigned than the withering of national life under the
blight of civil and ecclesiastical tyranny. The reform of
the Church, the purification of morals, excellent things
in themselves, had been bought from the counter-Reformation
at far too high a price.</p>

<p>We have indicated 1564 as the year in which the
North of Europe begins to gain steadily at the expense
of the South. The date especially fatal to Italy
may perhaps be carried five years back, to 1559,
when the long contest between France and Spain for
supremacy in the Peninsula was decided in favour of
the latter by the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. Up to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
time the Italians had been in some measure able to
play their oppressors off against each other; and such
from Alexander the Sixth’s time had been the policy of
the Popes, who all wished the expulsion of the barbarians,
in so far as compatible with their own family
interests. The accommodation between the foreign
Herod and the foreign Pilate put an end to this system.
The hope of the independence of Italy was definitively
resigned, the minor princes submitted to be Spanish
vassals, and the Popes indemnified themselves by enlisting
the monarchs in support of their spiritual authority.
Jesuits, seminary priests, and inquisitors darkened the
land, and the ever-augmenting pressure culminated at
last in the rules for censorship promulgated by Clement
VIII. in 1595, which effectually stifled freedom of thought,
and stopped the dissemination of knowledge, except by
leave of those whose interest it was to prevent it. Not
merely were heretical or licentious writings interdicted,
but criticism on rulers and ecclesiastics, and praises of
the freedom and virtue of antiquity.</p>

<p>Such satires as those in which, in the days of the
Renaissance, Alamanni and other orthodox Catholics
had scourged the sins of Church and State, could now
be printed only in Protestant countries. Anything
might be prohibited that shocked the prejudice or surpassed
the comprehension of an ignorant and bigoted
priest. Authors were discouraged from writing, booksellers
from publishing, and readers from reading, while
the frivolous pedantry and execrable taste of the Jesuits
infected almost all the schools. Renaissance had become
reaction; the new birth had passed into the second death.
This iron despotism could not be perpetually maintained.
It was impossible to shut Italians out from all knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
of the intellectual progress of Protestant countries, nor
in the universal flux of things could the stern inquisitorial
type of ecclesiastical ruler be stereotyped for ever. In
course of time the <em>zelanti</em> Popes gave way to affable and
humane personages, but the nation had meanwhile sunk
into a mental torpor, in which, with a few glorious exceptions,
it remained plunged until the crash of the old
order of things in the French Revolution. The exclusion
of the vivifying spirit of the Reformation, the impossibility
of so much as alluding, except in disparagement,
to the chief transaction of contemporary history, indicate
an emasculation, as well as a paralysis, beyond the power
of language to express.</p>

<p>The extinction of the free spirit of the Renaissance
was the more unfortunate for Italy, as it arrested the
development of speculative and scientific research which
seemed opening upon her. It has been frequently
observed that the close of a brilliant literary epoch has
coincided with the birth of an era of positive science.
The early Greek philosophers follow Homer and the
rhapsodists; Aristotle and Theophrastus, Epicurus and
Zeno, succeed the dramatists and the orators; the
decline of Latin literature is the age of the illustrious
jurists. Even so, as the great authors and the great
artists departed from Italy, she produced her greatest
man of science, and a bold school of philosophers arose
to challenge the authority to which Dante and Aquinas
had bowed. “Philosophy,” says Symonds, “took a new
point of departure among the Italians, and all the fundamental
ideas which have since formed the staple of
modern European systems were anticipated by a few
obscure thinkers.”</p>

<p>The chief representative of physical science, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
was by no means obscure. G<small>ALILEO</small> G<small>ALILEI</small> was born
in 1564, the year of the death of Michael Angelo. The
scientific achievements of this mighty genius do not concern
us as such. It must not be forgotten, however,
that he was also an accomplished author in the vernacular.
His immortal Dialogue (1632), the glory and the
shame of his age, is written in Italian, and is enumerated
by Italians among exemplars of diction, <em>testi di lingua</em>.
What he might have accomplished if he had enjoyed
the applause and sympathy which greeted a Newton is
difficult to say; but the contrast between the lot of the
Master of the Mint and the President of the Royal
Society on the one hand, and that of the lonely captive
on the other, is not greater than that between
the condition of England and that of Italy. It is needless
to relate the oft-told story of Galileo, which indeed
rather regards the history of science than that of literature.
We are only concerned with him as a typical
figure, the most eminent victim of the spirit of persecution
which deprived Italy of her supremacy among
intellectual nations, and which, even before Galileo had
excited its hatred, had claimed another victim, less
illustrious, but not less interesting.</p>

<p>It is probably owing to the considerable infusion of
Greek blood into Naples and Sicily that the inhabitants
of these regions, so backward in many respects in
comparison with the rest of Italy, have displayed a
peculiar genius for philosophical research. Aquinas
was a Neapolitan, and in our own day the subtleties
of German metaphysics have found a more sympathetic
reception and a more ready comprehension in
the South than elsewhere in Italy. The four chief
Italian thinkers of the late sixteenth and early seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>teenth
centuries belonged to the kingdom of Naples.
B<small>ERNARDO</small> T<small>ELESIO</small> (1509-85) has missed the posthumous
celebrity of the others by escaping their tragic
fate; but his reputation in his own day was greater than
theirs. Campanella wept at his tomb, and Bacon calls
him the first experimental observer of nature. He led
the way in the revolt against the authority of Aristotle
which became general in the seventeenth century, and
his sensationalism helped to mould the thought of
Hobbes and Gassendi.</p>

<p>A fiery martyrdom, a sublimely poetical mind, and
an intuition of modern views and discoveries have made
G<small>IORDANO</small> B<small>RUNO</small> a more celebrated and interesting
figure than Telesio, although too far in advance of his
contemporaries and too late recognised by posterity
to be influential with either. “The most faithful and
pithily condensed abstract of Bruno’s philosophy,” says
Symonds, “is contained in Goethe’s poem, <em>Prôömium
zu Gott und Welt</em>. Yet this poem expresses Goethe’s
thought, and it is doubtful whether Goethe had studied
Bruno except in the work of his disciple, Spinoza.”
“Disciple,” it may be added, is much too strong a word
to express the Hebrew thinker’s relation to the Neapolitan.
It would be difficult to conceive two men more
dissimilar, except in intellectual intrepidity and in love
of truth. Spinoza is the closest of reasoners, without
a particle of poetry in his composition. Bruno has
magnificent divinations, with little reasoning power. If
Spinoza did read him, he must have been greatly
annoyed by him. On the other hand, the celebrated
definition, “A God-intoxicated man,” which seems so
inappropriate to the intellectual geometer of Amsterdam,
absolutely fits the rapt Neapolitan prophet of the essential
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
unity of all things. The same vehemence which we
have remarked in Neapolitan men of letters&mdash;Pontano,
Tansillo, Basile&mdash;combines in Bruno with the metaphysical
instinct of the race to form a poet-philosopher,
as incoherent as if he had just emerged from
the Sibyl’s cave, but full of the most surprising intuitions,
instinct with the germs of modern thought and
discovery. His very incoherence seems a claim to
reverence; it does not convey the impression of intellectual
inadequacy, but rather of an inspired message
transcending mortal powers of speech. A chastened
taste cannot but be offended by the drollery and burlesque
which, like a true Neapolitan, Bruno blends with
daring speculation and serious reflection, as well as
by his gaudy rhetoric and exaggerated euphuism; yet
Symonds is right in observing that “when the real
divine œstrum descends upon him the thought is
simple, the diction direct; the attitude of mind and
the turn of expression are singularly living, surprisingly
modern.”</p>

<p>Like Galileo, Bruno chose the dialogue as the most
convenient form of propagating his opinions, and unlike
most contemporary philosophers, claims a place among
vernacular writers. In his <em>Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante</em>
and his comedy <em>Il Candelaio</em> he is satirical; metaphysically
speculative in the <em>Cena delle Ceneri</em>, <em>Della Causa</em>,
and <em>Dell’ Infinito Universo</em>; but perhaps the most interesting
of his works is <em>Gli Eroici Furori</em>, dedicated to
Sir Philip Sidney, a dithyramb in prose and verse on
the progress of the soul to union with the Divinity.
It may be too much to say with the English translator
that in this remarkable book the author “lays down
the basis for the religion of thought and science”; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
it is true that the ordinary ecclesiastical ideals are thrust
aside, and progress in truth, knowledge, and justice
declared to be the end of man. If many had thought
so, none had said it so openly. Bruno, however,
never learned to observe, and remained all his life the
metaphysician and the poet. Chief among his intuitions,
after his perception of the unity of all existence, must
be placed his instinctive recognition of the immense
revolution which the acceptance of the Copernican
theory must effect in religious belief. It is probable
that he thus alarmed the priesthood ere he could
arouse the laity, and that to him must be ascribed the
persecution of Galileo, nearly a century after Copernicus
had been permitted to dedicate his treatise to
the Pope.</p>

<p>Bruno’s own martyrdom had preceded Galileo’s; he
suffered death in February 1600, after a life of constant
flight and exile, which at one time brought him to
England, where he lectured at Oxford and became
Sidney’s friend, and latterly of imprisonment. His fate
is a striking illustration of the dismal though inevitable
change that had come over the spirit of the ecclesiastical
rulers: a Renaissance Pope would probably have
protected him. His name long seemed forgotten, and
his writings obliterated. Early in the eighteenth century
interest in him revived, as is shown by the collection
of his works in Lord Sunderland’s library. Brucker
gave an intelligible digest of his opinions; Schelling
avowedly sought inspiration from him; Coleridge names
him with Dante and Ariosto as one of the three most
representative Italians; and at present, even though he
be chiefly efficient through his influence on more disciplined
geniuses and more systematic thinkers, the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
has hardly a more striking example of the truth, “The
stone which the builders rejected, the same is become
the head of the corner.”</p>

<p>As Bruno is the personification of martyrdom in the
cause of philosophical speculation, another Neapolitan
philosopher of the age, the Dominican T<small>OMMASO</small> C<small>AMPANELLA</small>
(1568-1639) represents martyrdom for the sake
of country. Campanella is not only a less important
figure than Bruno, but less sane and practical. With
all his extravagance, Bruno is no visionary; if he sometimes
appears obscure and confused, the defect is not
in the brain, but in the tongue. Campanella, though
endowed with profound ideas, was a visionary who
based his hopes of delivering his country from the
Spanish yoke on predictions of the millennium, to be
fulfilled by the advent of the Turks, and was sufficiently
paradoxical to dream of a perfect republic in the
kingdom of Naples. But this alliance of mental unsoundness
with extraordinary intelligence renders him
deeply interesting; unlike the frank and candid Bruno,
he is one of the <em>problematische Naturen</em> who, as Goethe
justly says, perpetually attract mankind. The flower of
his life (1599-1625) was spent in prison, and some of
it in torture, on account of a conspiracy which, after
all the investigations of Signor Amabile, remains in many
respects obscure, but which was undoubtedly designed
to free Naples from the yoke, not only of Spain, but
of Rome.</p>

<p>Released at length, Campanella successively found an
asylum at Rome and at Paris, where he died in 1639.
As his captivity became milder, he had been permitted
to write, and to receive visits from friends, through
whom his works found their way to the public. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span>
are mostly of a political character. The chief, <em>De Sensu
et Magia Naturali</em>, is a curious blending of philosophy
and occultism; another, a defence of Galileo, does
him honour, even though he afterwards changed his
view; but another, <em>De Monarchia Universali</em>, seeks to
revive the mediæval idea of the universal Church
and the universal Empire, substituting Spain for Germany.
Until the rediscovery of his poems, his literary
reputation principally rested upon one of his slightest
productions, his <em>City of the Sun</em>, an Utopian picture of
a perfect community. It contains a remarkable anticipation
of the steamboat: “They possess rafts and
triremes which go over the waters without rowers or
the force of the wind, but by a marvellous contrivance.
And other vessels they have which are moved by the
winds.”</p>

<p>Campanella’s claims as a vernacular writer rest entirely
upon his poems, of which there are said to have been
seven books. With the exception of some extracted
from the documents of his trial by the diligence of
Signor Amabile, all that remain are the sonnets printed
in Germany by his disciple, Tobias Adami, in 1622,
and forgotten until their republication by Orelli, in
1834. But for these pieces we should not know the
real Campanella, whom they exhibit in a more favourable
light, even as a thinker, than does the brilliant
intuition, chequered with gross credulity, of his professedly
philosophical writings. Like Michael Angelo’s,
they are rather hewn than written&mdash;the utterances of a
powerful intellect and a passionate heart seeking to
express themselves through a medium but imperfectly
mastered, hence vehement, abrupt, contorted even to the
verge of absurdity, but full of substance, and as remote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
as possible from the polished inanity which is so frequently
a reproach to the Italian sonnet. Addington
Symonds, wrestling with Campanella as Campanella
wrestled with his own language, has produced excellent
translations, accompanied by a careful commentary.
“That this sonnet,” he says of the following, “should
have been written by a Dominican monk, in a Neapolitan
prison, in the first half of the seventeenth century,
is truly noteworthy:”</p>

<p class="p1">Some of Campanella’s other sonnets are very striking,
especially his impassioned remonstrance with the free
Swiss for hiring themselves out to Italian despots. His
religious pieces are characterised by a devout tone, and
an unshakeable reliance upon Providence. His creed,
like Bruno’s, is pantheistic. The same is the case with
another Neapolitan thinker of less importance, G<small>IULIO</small>
C<small>ESARE</small> V<small>ANINI</small> (1585-1626), whose misunderstood pantheism
caused him to be burned at Toulouse, the most
intolerant city in France. His writings are in Latin,
but so characteristically Italian in spirit as to deserve the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
attention of Italian students. Out of many which he
composed, only two were printed. The <em>Amphitheatre</em>
is, in the opinion of Mr. Owen (<em>Sceptics of the Italian
Renaissance</em>), decidedly orthodox, the <em>Dialogues</em> are as
decidedly free-thinking, but it is not always quite clear
how far the author is speaking in his own person.</p>

<p>While these adventurous speculators were infusing a
ferment into the quiescent thought of their day, the
edifice of modern jurisprudence was receiving important
additions from Alberico Gentili, a Protestant exile,
happily in safety at Oxford, whose works, nevertheless,
belong rather to moral science than to literature. Much
at the same time prose literature was enriched by the
ethical prolusions of the most distinguished poet of
the age. Though suffering from delusions sometimes
amounting to frenzy, Tasso’s brain was clear on all
subjects to which these delusions did not extend. He
could reason powerfully and gracefully on any question
of taste or morals, arrange his ideas with symmetry, and
support his views with appropriate quotations. The
form which he adopted was the dialogue, requiring not
only judgment and memory, but an accurate discrimination
between the interlocutors, which he always maintains.
Even the discourse with his familiar spirit,
although composed in the hospital for lunatics, and
containing many fantastic notions, is consecutive and
rational. It is perhaps the most interesting of any,
from its close relation to the writer; although almost
as much may be said for the <em>Gonzaga</em>, in which Tasso
celebrates the noble conduct of his father in preferring
public duty to private interest; and the <em>Paterfamilias</em>,
in which he describes a personal adventure. His other
dialogues, all models of elegance and urbanity, usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
treat of those virtues which enter most especially into
the character of a gentleman, and his own bad success
at courts does not discourage him from tendering advice
to courtiers.</p>

<p>A more powerful intellect if a less accomplished pen
than Tasso’s forms a connecting link between the science,
alike moral and physical, and the historical erudition of
the age. P<small>IETRO</small> S<small>ARPI</small> (1552-1623) would in our day
have been a great natural philosopher; and in fact, notwithstanding
his profound knowledge both of theology
and canon law, his reputation long principally rested
upon his experiments and researches in optics, anatomy,
and other natural sciences. Paul the Fifth’s aggression
upon Sarpi’s native Venice in a matter of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction summoned the modest friar to public life, and
after the triumphant issue of the controversy in which
he had borne the chief part, he turned to write the history
of the momentous assembly which had so deeply
affected the character of the Church of Rome for good
and ill&mdash;the Council of Trent. As a liberal thinker,
whose creed approached without quite attaining the Protestant
standpoint, he was naturally hostile to a convocation
which had stereotyped so many corruptions; while
as an ecclesiastical statesman he was well able to penetrate
the worldly motives which had actuated its conveners
from first to last. The substantial truth of his
view of it is generally admitted; it remains a question
how far he has dealt conscientiously with his materials.
The equitable Ranke subjects both him and the antagonistic
historian, Cardinal Sforza Pallavicino, to a close
scrutiny, and finds himself unable to entirely acquit or
condemn either of them. Both have frequently displayed
a praiseworthy fairness under strong temptation to garble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
the documents before them, but neither has always resisted
the inducement to magnify or minimise evidence
in accordance with his prepossessions. Sarpi’s main
fault is a disposition to interpret every document in the
light of his own times, when the pretensions of the
Papacy had greatly risen, and its spirit had become more
inflexible and despotic. This, however it may detract
from the value of his history, was pardonable in one who
had taken a leading part in resisting the most arrogant
of the Popes, and had been left for dead by assassins,
suborned, as generally believed, by the Papal court. As
an advocate, Sarpi is far superior to his verbose though
often ingenious antagonist; as an historian, Ranke places
him immediately after Machiavelli. As a man, he appears
sublimed by study and suffering into an incarnation
of pure intellect, passionless except in his zeal for
truth and freedom and his devotion to the Republic.
“Let us,” he nobly said when the Pope hurled his interdict
at Venice&mdash;“let us be Venetians first and Christians
afterwards.”</p>

<p>The secular historians of the period are very numerous,
but, with the exception of the Latinist Strada, only
two have attained a durable celebrity. Enrico Caterino
Davila (1576-1631), who had become well acquainted
with French affairs by military service in the wars of
religion, wrote the history of these contests from 1558
to 1598 “with Venetian sagacity and soldierly brevity.”
He wants few of the qualifications of an excellent historian,
and his history is placed not far below that
of Guicciardini, to which, indeed, it is preferred by
Macaulay. He is accused, however, of affecting more
penetration than he possessed into the secret counsels
of princes. Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio’s history of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
revolt of the Low Countries against the Spaniards (1558-1609)
is necessarily defective as coming from the wrong
side. Such a history could not be adequately written
without sympathy with its heroes and comprehension
of the principles involved, neither of which could be
expected from a Papal nuncio. Bentivoglio nevertheless
writes with reasonable impartiality, and is well informed on
the exterior of the transactions he records, though utterly
blind to their real significance. His style is most agreeable.
His relation of his mission as nuncio, with speculations
on the possibility of suppressing the Reformation
in England and elsewhere, is perhaps more intrinsically
valuable than his history; and his memoirs of his own
career at the Papal court, though necessarily worded
with great reserve and caution, are both entertaining
and instructive. He was born in 1577, and died in conclave
in 1644, just as he seemed about to be elected
Pope; done to death, Nicius Erythræus affirms, by the
snoring of the Cardinal in the next cell, which deprived
him of sleep for eleven successive nights.</p>

<p>All the authors we have mentioned, though for the
most part writing in the seventeenth century, were born
in the sixteenth. The seventeenth century was far
advanced towards its close ere it had produced a single
prose-writer of literary importance, although some of its
numerous penmen were interesting for their characters
or the circumstances of their lives. Bartoli’s <em>History
of the Society of Jesus</em> is badly executed, but important
from its subject. G<small>REGORIO</small> L<small>ETI</small> was the most
representative figure, personifying the spirit of revolt
against tyranny spiritual and political. Born at Milan
in 1630, he emigrated to Geneva, became a Protestant,
and, after a roving life, eventually settled at Amsterdam,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
where he died historiographer of the city in 1701. He
had already constituted himself a historiographer and
biographer general, writing the lives of kings, princes,
and governors, and depicting the rise and fall of states,
as fast as bookseller could commission, or printer put
into type. Yet he is not a hack writer, but has an individuality
of his own, and although his works are devoid
of scientific worth, they served a useful purpose in their
day by asserting freedom of speech. Their value is in
proportion to the degree in which they subserve this
purpose; the most important, therefore, are his lives of
Sixtus V. and of Innocent the Tenth’s rapacious and imperious
niece, Olimpia Maldachini. Ranke has clearly
shown that the former, which has done more than any
other book to determine popular opinion regarding
Sixtus, is mainly derived from MS. authorities of little
value; which proves that Leti did not invent, but also that
he did not discriminate.</p>

<p>Several other writers approached Leti’s type, of whom
Tomasi, the author of a very uncritical life of Cæsar
Borgia, may be taken as a specimen. Two emigrant
Italians, Siri and Marana, ministered successfully to the
growing appetite for news and political criticism, soon
to engender regular journalism; the former by his
<em>Mercurio</em>, published irregularly from 1644 to 1682; the
latter by his ingenious <em>Turkish Spy</em>. Ferrante Pallavicino
enlivened the general dulness by his <em>Divorzio Celeste</em>, a
conception worthy of Lucian, though not worked out
as Lucian would have wrought it, and other satires
which eventually cost him his life. T<small>RAJANO</small> B<small>OCCALINI</small>,
nearer the commencement of the century, had treated
political as well as literary affairs with freedom in his
<em>News from Parnassus</em>, in which he professed to impart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
information respecting transactions in the kingdom of
Apollo. The fiction was greatly admired in its day,
translated into most European languages, and probably
exerted considerable influence upon Quevedo, Swift,
and Addison. Boccalini also distinguished himself as
a commentator on Tacitus, a writer much studied at
this epoch of general gloom and discouragement, and
as the author of an exposure of the weakness of the
Spanish monarchy, which is said to have occasioned his
assassination.</p>

<p>The one writer, however, whom it is possible to admire
without qualification, and who has preserved his
freshness to our own day, is a traveller, P<small>IETRO DELLA</small>
V<small>ALLE</small>, who between 1614 and 1626 explored Turkey,
Egypt, Syria, Persia, and part of India. Apart from the
prejudices inevitable in his age and country, Della Valle
is the model of an observant and sagacious voyager, and
the letters in which his observations are recorded form
most delightful reading. Later in the century excellent
letters on scientific subjects were written by Magalotti and
Redi. The illustrious naturalists who in some measure
redeemed the intellectual barrenness of the epoch, do
not fall within the domain of literary history, which,
except for some poets, is one of ever-augmenting inanity
and insipidity, culminating in absolute sterility. A second
Greece had been enslaved, but this time the fierce conqueror
refused to be himself led into captivity. Spain
and the Papacy and their victim were equally useless to
culture, which would have perished from the earth had
it still been confined to the fair land</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>THE POETRY OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>The blight that fell upon Italian literature near the close
of the sixteenth century was in the main to be ascribed
to tyranny, temporal and spiritual. Yet there was another
source of ill for which neither monarch nor priest was
responsible: this was the malady which necessarily
befalls every form of literature and art when the bounds
of perfection have been reached, the craving to improve
upon what is incapable of improvement; first, perhaps,
distinctly evinced in this age by the Spanish bishop
Guevara, author of the <em>Dial of Princes</em> (1529), who invented
what he called the <em>estilo alto</em>, which, if not
absolutely the predominant, had by the end of the
century become a conspicuous element in every European
literature. The true course would have been a
new departure like that made by the Spanish and Dutch
masters when Italian art had fulfilled its mission; but
this requires not only genius, but the concurrence of
favourable social and political circumstances, without
which nothing is possible but servile repetition or preposterous
exaggeration. Genius born amid inauspicious
surroundings is more prone to elect the latter than the
former alternative, and the greater the natural gift, the
more outrageous the abuse likely to be made of it.</p>

<p>Such epidemics are of no unfrequent occurrence in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
the history of every literature; but at the beginning
of the seventeenth century the plague was common
to all, and it was but natural that none should suffer
so severely as that which had hitherto been the model
of good taste. There seems no good reason for
attributing this particular affliction to Spanish influence.
Spain had her Gongora, as Italy her Marini, but there
is no evidence that either taught the other. It was
a prevalent malady, which left Italian prose by no means
unaffected. Cardinal Bentivoglio, himself a model of
pure and simple composition in prose, though in verse
an admirer of Marini, says of the poet Ciampoli, redactor
of briefs under Clement VIII., that his style would have
been in place if he had been inditing an heroic poem.
Ciampoli’s poetry was not likely to be more chastened
than his prose; and in truth the determination to dazzle
and astonish at any cost was inevitably most conspicuous
in the branch of literature where a divine transport, when
real and not simulated, is rightly held to excuse many
lapses from absolute purity of diction; and where, as
was also to be expected, the arch offender was a man of
genuine gifts, who with more natural refinement and
moral earnestness might have regenerated the literature
of his country, but whose false brilliancy only served to
lure it further astray.</p>

<p>It is the best apology of G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> M<small>ARINI</small>
(1569-1625) to have been born a Neapolitan. From
the days of Statius till now, these vehement children of
the South have been great improvisers. Could we look
upon Marini in this light, we should find little but his
voluptuousness to censure, and should be compelled to
admire him in some measure as a remarkable phenomenon,
only lamenting that his contemporaries should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
mistaken a <em>lusus naturæ</em> for an inspired genius, a calculating
boy for a Newton or a Galileo. It might indeed
have been better for Marini if he had trusted more to his
natural faculty for improvisation. “His first strokes,”
says Settembrini, “are sometimes beautiful, and if he
left them as they were all would be well, but he touches
and retouches until they are quite blurred.” This refers
to the descriptions in his <em>Adone</em> (1623), a poem which
is nothing but description. Adonis does nothing, but is
carried involuntarily through a series of situations contrived
to display the pictorial power of the poet. The
showman makes the puppet dance, and the puppet
returns the compliment. There is no story, no moral,
no character, no inner unity, nothing but forty-five
thousand lines of word-painting, rich and brilliant
indeed, but commonplace in so far as the poet sees
nothing invisible to ordinary eyes, and evinces no originality
in his manner of regarding man and nature.</p>

<p>Such merely verbal beauty must inevitably satiate,
and Marini has experienced more neglect, and even
contempt, than many men of far inferior faculty. In his
own day he carried all before him, and was even more
admired in France than in Italy. It is at least to his
credit not to have undertaken his gorgeous but empty
<em>Adone</em> until he had convinced himself of his inability
to vie with Tasso in a nobler form of epic. He also
composed one really dignified poem on the deplorable
condition of Italy (attributed, however, by many to
Fulvio Testi), and poured forth a flood of idyllic and
bucolic, marine, erotic, and lyrical poetry, not devoid of
striking beauties, but so disfigured by conceits as to be
necessarily condemned to oblivion upon the revival of a
purer taste. In some respects he might be compared to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
the Cowleys and Crashaws of Charles the First’s time;
but he is physical, while they are metaphysical; his conceits
are less far-fetched and ingenious than theirs, and
few of them either could or would have produced his
licentious, but, in an artistic point of view, admirable
<em>Pastorella</em>. Marini’s influence on the contemporary
poetry of his own country was very great; but the
two or three men of genius remained unaffected by
him, and the names of his multitudinous imitators are
not worth preserving. His life, though chequered by
scrapes and quarrels, was on the whole prosperous,
and the patronage of the French court made him
independent of the petty princes of Italy. He had
bitter enemies in Gasparo Murtola, a poet who would
be forgotten but for his and Marini’s mutual lampoons,
and Tommaso Stigliani, a more considerable personage,
who had enjoyed the great honour of being run through
the body by the historian Davila, and whose early promise
had drawn a sonnet from Tasso, remarkable for the
hint it affords that Tasso himself had projected an epic
upon Columbus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

<em>Thy song Orphean, able to placate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Stygian thrones, and wailing shades appease,</span><br />

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p class="p1">The peculiar appropriateness of Tasso’s compliment
arises from the fact that Stigliani was then engaged upon
an epic on the discovery of America, which was far from
justifying Torquato’s predictions.</p>

<p>The style of Marini, however, was not allowed to bear
unchallenged sway. The first place in lyrical poetry was
boldly claimed by, and by many accorded to, another bard,
whose personal and poetical idiosyncrasies stood in strong
contrast to the Neapolitan’s. G<small>ABRIELLO</small> C<small>HIABRERA</small>
(1552-1637), a native of Savona, was a man of antique
mould, haughty, aspiring, and self-sufficing. His youth
was spent at Rome. Jealous of his honour, he found
himself, as he tells us in his autobiography, necessitated
to wash out sundry affronts in blood, which he accomplished
to his satisfaction, but whether in single combat
or in other fashion he does not explicitly say. Retired
for safety to his native Ligurian town, and digesting the
large assortment of ideas which he had brought away
with him from the literary circles of Rome, he hit upon
the great discovery of his life, that the Italian canzone
needed to be reformed upon a Greek model. It really
was a discovery which changed the whole course of his
literary activity&mdash;of no such importance as that of the
need of a closer observation of nature which Wordsworth
deduced from noticing the blackness of a leaf outlined
against a sunny sky, but still a genuine discovery. Its
value lay not so much in its abstract worth or in any real
assimilation of the spirit of Greek poetry by Chiabrera,
but in an endeavour after a high standard, which, even
when misdirected, proved the best corrective of the
inanity and effeminacy to which the Italian canzone
had become prone.</p>

<p>Chiabrera might be somewhat conventional in style<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
and barren in thought: he was all the more a precious
antidote to the dissolute lusciousness of a Marini, and
his example exercised a salutary influence throughout
the whole of the seventeenth century. So late as 1740,
Spence, travelling in Italy, was told that the Italian
lyrical poets of the day were divisible into Petrarchists
and Chiabrerists. The popularity of so bold an innovator,
and the honours and distinctions showered upon
him by princes and potentates, are creditable to the
age. He wrote his brief autobiography at eighty, and
died at eighty-five, exulting to the last in his sanity of
mind and body; distinguished also, according to Rossi
(Nicius Erythræus), as the ugliest of the poets: “Quis
enim qui ejus faciem aspexisset, arbitratus esset, ex
illius ore subnigro, tetrico, invenusto, tam candidula,
tam vinula, tam venustula carmina posse prodere?” A
man congenial to Wordsworth, who has translated some
of his stately metrical epitaphs with corresponding
dignity.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He has many traits of those great modern
masters of form, Landor and Platen, but, though no
mean sculptor of speech, falls as much behind them in
perfection of classic mould as he surpasses them in
productiveness.</p>


<p>Chiabrera wrote several epics, dramas, poems on
sacred history, and other pieces, and the mass of his
poetry is of formidable extent; but apart from his
<em>Sermoni</em>, felicitous imitations of Horace, he lives solely
by his lyrics. These fall into two classes, which he
would have described as Pindaric and Anacreontic.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>The former are set compositions of great pomp and
magnificence; not like Marini’s poems, depending upon
verbal beauty alone, but upon a real if formal grandeur
of style. They are less like the notes of Apollo’s lyre
than orchestras of all sorts of instruments, “flute, violin,
bassoon,” but more particularly bassoon. They are
splendidly sonorous, and exhibit great art in heightening
ordinary ideas by magnificent diction. Of the wild, untutored
graces of the woods and fields they have absolutely
nothing; their sphere is the court, save for the
feeling which Chiabrera, as becomes a Ligurian, occasionally
manifests for the sea; and the ideas are seldom
absolutely novel, though they often seem so. But there
is true elevation of thought and majesty of diction: a
lyrical afflatus seems to descend upon the poet and whirl
him on, sped, in the absence of a really inspiring subject,
by his own excitement, as a courser is urged along by
the thunder of his own hoofs. Yet there is no factitious
emotion, the theme is really for the moment everything
to the poet, while he remains sufficiently master of himself
to turn every strong point to the best account.</p>

<p>Like the surviving lyrics of his model Pindar, his odes
are usually addressed to particular persons or prompted
by some event. Among the best are the long series he
poured forth on occasion of the trifling victories gained
by the Italian galleys over the Turks, which prove how
fine a patriotic poet he might have been if his age had
given him anything better to celebrate. His Anacreontics
precisely correspond to his Pindarics, brilliant effusions
with more glitter than glow, but ingenious, felicitous,
and transcending mere rhetoric by the exquisite music
of the versification. Chiabrera is not an Italian Pindar
or Anacreon, and his natural gift for poetry was inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
to Marini’s; but he is entitled to the great honour of
having barred out by a strong dike the flood of false
taste, and having conferred dignity upon a most unpropitious
age of Italian literature.</p>

<p>Chiabrera’s mantle fell upon Count F<small>ULVIO</small> T<small>ESTI</small>
(1593-1646), in some respects a more genuine poet,
though his inferior in splendour of language and harmony
of versification, and like him infertile in ideas
and contracted in his outlook upon the world. Testi
was nevertheless an interesting personage, picturesque
in the style of Rembrandt or Caravaggio, an unquiet
spirit, haughty, moody, vindictive. Under a free government
he might have been a great citizen, but the circumstances
of his age left him no other sphere than court
or diplomatic employment. He was not the man to
run easily in harness, and spent his life in losing and
regaining the favour of the Este princes, now come down
to be Dukes of Modena, but still with places and pensions
in their gift, and died in prison, just as, if the Duke may
be believed, he was on the point of being released.
If so, the cause of his disgrace was probably nothing
graver than his wish to quit the Duke’s service. In any
case, the tale of his having been secretly decapitated to
appease the resentment of Cardinal Antonio Barberini,
satirised in his famous canzone, <em>Ruscelletto orgoglioso</em>,
seems to be a mere legend.</p>

<p>This canzone is undoubtedly one of the finest lyrics
in the Italian language, magnificent alike in its description
of the swollen rivulet and in its application to the
inflated upstart. The rest of Testi’s better compositions
resemble it; they are odes stately in diction and
sonorous in versification, fine examples of the grand
style in poetry, and proving what dignity of style can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
effect even without any considerable opulence or striking
novelty of thought. They are usually on subjects personal
to himself, sometimes depicting the miseries of
court life with the feeling that comes from experience,
sometimes affecting a philosophical tranquillity to which
he was really a stranger. One stands out from the rest,
the poem which he addressed in his youth to the Duke
of Savoy, exhorting him to deliver Italy from the Spaniards.
Testi was not alone in the prophetic foresight that the
redemption of Italy would come from Savoy. Campanella,
Chiabrera, and others of the best Italians of the
day shared it with him, but no other has given it such
direct and eloquent expression. The genius of Italy
appears in vision to the poet, enumerates her wrongs,
denounces her oppressor, and calls for vengeance in a
series of most animated octaves, equally impressive and
persuasive.</p>

<p>Marini’s school continued to dominate literary circles,
although Rossi assures us that Testi’s simplicity was
more acceptable to readers at large. “The sun,” says
Vernon Lee, “cooled itself in the waters of rivers which
were on fire; the celestial sieve, resplendent with shining
holes, was swept by the bristly back of the Apennines;
love was an infernal heaven and a celestial hell,
it was burning ice and freezing fire, and was inspired
by ladies made up entirely of coral, gold thread, lilies,
roses, and ivory, on whose lips sat Cupids shooting
arrows which were snakes.” Poetry worthy of the
name seemed extinct after Testi’s death, and the literature
of England being then unknown beyond her own
borders, the sceptre over every department of intellectual
activity except science passed into the hand of
France. After a while, however, signs of revival became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
apparent. The writers who restored to Italy some
share of her ancient glory were all strongly influenced
by Chiabrera.</p>

<p>The first of these in order of time was a man who
would have been famous if he had never written a
verse, F<small>RANCESCO</small> R<small>EDI</small> (1626-99), the illustrious physician
and naturalist. One would scarcely have expected
this eager scrutiniser of nature to have come forward as
a Bacchanalian laureate; but certain it is that, neglecting
the more imposing side of Chiabrera’s poetical work,
Redi applied himself to develop the dithyramb in its
strict sense of a Bacchic song. Chiabrera had given
excellent examples of this on a small scale; but Redi
completely distanced him with his <em>Bacchus in Tuscany</em>,
where the jolly god, returned from his Indian conquest,
for the benefit of Ariadne passes in review literally
and figuratively all the wines of Tuscany, with
such consequences as is reasonable to expect. The
literary character of the piece cannot be better described
than by Salfi, the continuator of Ginguené, as “consisting
in the enthusiasm which passes rapidly from
one theme to another, and, seeming to say nothing but
what it chooses, says, in effect, nothing but what it
should.” Dryden evidently had it in mind when he
wrote <em>Alexander’s Feast</em>, and the difficulties of translation
have been surprisingly overcome by Leigh Hunt. Redi’s
sonnets are also remarkable, occasionally tame in subject
or disfigured by conceits, but in general nobly thought
and nobly expressed, with a strong Platonic element.
They nearly all relate to Love, and fall into two well-marked
divisions, one upbraiding him as the source of
perpetual torment, the other celebrating him as the
symbol of Divinity, and the chief agent by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
man is raised above himself. The latter thought has
seldom been more finely expressed than in the following
pair of sonnets, the first of which is translated
by Mr. Gosse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Love is the Minstrel; for in God’s own sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The master of all melody, he stands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And holds a golden rebeck in his hands,</span><br />
And leads the chorus of the saints in light;<br />
But ever and anon those chambers bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Detain him not, for down to these low lands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He flies, and spreads his musical commands,</span><br />
And teaches men some fresh divine delight.<br />
For with his bow he strikes a single chord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across a soul, and wakes in it desire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To grow more pure and lovely, and aspire</span><br />
To that ethereal country where, outpoured<br />
From myriad stars that stand before the Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love’s harmonies are like a flame of fire.</span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>If I am aught, it is Love’s miracle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He to rough mass gave shape with forming file;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He, as youth bloomed in April’s sunny smile,</span><br />
Came through the eyes within the heart to dwell.<br />
My Lord and Master he, who bade expel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All sordid thought and apprehension vile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetness bestowed on rude unmellowed style,</span><br />
And melody that shall be memorable.<br />
My spirit at his call her pinions bent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wing the heavenly realm where Time is not;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From star to star he beckoned, and she went:</span><br />
By him my heart hath chosen for her lot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">True honour whose renown shall ne’er be spent;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If aught my soul hath borne, ’twas he begot.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Poets are often found to be gregarious. Redi had two
chief friends at the Tuscan court&mdash;Menzini, of whom we
shall have to speak, and Filicaja, who in an unpoetical
age raised the Italian lyric to as great a height as it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
ever attained in the Cinque Cento. V<small>INCENZO</small> F<small>ILICAJA</small>
(1642-1707) is one of the highest examples the world
has seen of the academical poet, the man who is rarely
hurried away by the god, but who seriously and perseveringly
follows poetry as an art, in whose breast the
sacred fire is always burning, but always needing to be
stirred up. A grave, just magistrate, and a deeply religious
man, he was well constituted to sing events of
such importance to the Christian commonwealth as the
deliverance of Vienna by Sobieski, and, from his point
of view, the conversion of Queen Christina. Tender,
affectionate, and carrying with him the life-long wound
of an unfortunate passion, he was no less qualified to
be the laureate of domestic sorrow, while his elevation
of mind lent uncommon dignity to many of his occasional
pieces, especially his sonnets. If only his scrolls
smelt less of the lamp he might deserve Macaulay’s
exaggerated praise as the greatest lyrist of modern
times, supposing this expression to denote the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The great qualities of Filicaja are majesty and tenderness.
The <em>non bene conveniunt nec in una sede morantur
majestas et amor</em> only applies to him in so far as these
gifts, though dwelling in the same breast, are not often
found united in the same poem. His canzoni possess
amplitude of form and pomp of diction, seldom or
never bombastic, or transgressing the limits of good
taste. From this the poet was preserved by his deep
seriousness, to which anything like tinsel was utterly
abhorrent. He strongly felt the obligation to exert his
utmost strength when writing on an important theme,
as he usually did when he wrote at all. It is his manner
to approach his subject from a variety of sides, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
make each the topic of a separate poem. Thus his
great cycle of odes on the relief of Vienna, perhaps
the finest of his works, consists of six separate productions,
constituting a grand whole, but any one of
which could have stood perfectly well by itself. Such
a method of composition implies great deliberation, and
Filicaja rarely conveys the impression of a seer or a
bard. His thoughts are sometimes trite, but the feeling
which gives them birth is always deep and sincere.
The same is true of the best of his numerous sonnets,
some of which rise to grandeur. By far the finest is the
famous <em>Italia, Italia, a cui feò la sorte</em>, which is to Italian
literature what Milton’s sonnet on the massacre of the
Vaudois is to English:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Italia, O Italia, doomed to wear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fatal wreath of loveliness, and so</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The record of illimitable woe</span><br />
Branded for ever on thy brow to bear!<br />
Would that less beauty or more vigour were<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy heritage! that they who madly glow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that which their own fury layeth low,</span><br />
More terrible might find thee, or less fair!<br />
Not from thine Alpine rampart should the horde<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of spoilers then descend, or crimson stain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of rolling Po quench thirst of Gallic steed:</span><br />
Nor should’st thou, girded with another’s sword,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smite with a foreign arm, enslavement’s chain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Victor or vanquished, equally thy meed.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Filicaja, however, did not always compose in this
majestic style. He could be light and playful. Some
of his sonnets, like those of Tansillo and other writers
of the Cinque Cento, strongly bring out the characteristic
distinction between the Italian and the English
sonnet, which is entirely in favour of the former. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span>
English sonnet, even when dealing with a light theme,
is apt to be ponderous. The Italian, even when serious,
is tuneful, and buoyant on the wing.</p>

<p>Filicaja fixed the model of the Italian canzone for a
long time, for the innovations of his successor A<small>LESSANDRO</small>
G<small>UIDI</small> (1650-1712), a protégé of Queen Christina,
and one of the founders of the “Arcadia,” had more
admirers than imitators. They consisted in the irregularity
and sometimes the disuse of rhyme, interesting as
experiments, but unfavourable to the stately march of
the most dignified form of lyrical composition. Guidi
was nevertheless a fine poet, and manifests a peculiar
fire and dignity when hymning the glories and tragedies
of Rome. He must have been a very ermine among
authors, if it be true that he died of disgust at a misprint
in one of his books.</p>

<p>Three other poets who did not aspire to the elevation
of Filicaja and Guidi, aided to re-enthrone sound taste,
and did honour to the end of the seventeenth century.
B<small>ENEDETTO</small> M<small>ENZINI</small> (1646-1704), another protégé of
Christina’s, and in some sense a pupil of Redi, wrote
caustic satires, graceful Anacreontics, respectable odes,
and an Art of Poetry as sound as could be expected
from one whose knowledge of modern literature was
so limited. To see, more than half a century after
Shakespeare, the Solimano and the Torrismondo propounded
as the highest modern examples of tragic
art certainly inspires cogitation touching the serviceableness
of the light within, supposing that light to be
darkness. Within his limits, however, Menzini is most
judicious, and his own compositions do credit to his
maxims; witness the following keen satiric apologue in
sonnet form:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>A tender slip of laurel I of late<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Implanted in fair soil, and Heaven besought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prosper till it might, to fulness brought,</span><br />
Enshade the brow august of Laureate;<br />
And Zephyrus to boot did supplicate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fan with soothing wing, lest harm in aught</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If, when the bay is worthy of the brow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brow there be also worthy of the bay.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Carlo Maria Maggi (1630-99), without soaring high,
did excellent work in ode, sonnet, and madrigal. Francesco
Lemene (1634-1704) was more ambitious, but his
tumid religious poetry has fallen into oblivion, and he
only lives by his pretty Anacreontics.</p>

<p>As the great questions which had divided the preceding
century became settled, and political interests narrowed
more and more, the spirit of the age naturally
turned to satire. Menzini is its best satirist; but at
an earlier period Chiabrera, Soldani, and the impetuous
and unequal Salvator Rosa had exercised themselves
in this department of literature, and the century’s last
literary sensation was the successive appearance of the
Latin satires of Sergardi (Sectanus), models of composition,
which for nearly a decade kept the reading portion
of the Roman public in an uproar. It might have
been thought that comedy would have flourished, but
some promising beginnings died away, while opera
progressed steadily. Tragedies continued to be written
on the classical system, but there was no power to
breathe life into the old forms, unless the great temporary
success of Prospero Bonarelli’s <em>Solimano</em>, which
we have seen Menzini parallel with Tasso’s <em>Torrismondo</em>,
may be taken to denote an exception. The <em>Phillis of
Scyros</em> of Bonarelli’s brother Giudubaldo was the one
achievement in pastoral drama. The novelette languished,
and chivalric fiction had but one representative
in Italy, the <em>Caloandro</em> of Giuseppe Ambrogio
Marini, an excellent romance nevertheless, ending with
five marriages, where monarchs and warriors play the
part of the antiquated knights-errant, and so superior
in sanity to the unwieldy fictions of the Clélie type
that Caylus thought it worth translating into French
in the following century. The <em>Eudemia</em> of J. V. Rossi
(Nicius Erythræus), in Latin, is a good specimen of
the <em>Argenis</em> class of romances. The same author’s
<em>Pinacotheca</em>, in three parts, a most entertaining repertory
of biographies, chiefly more or less literary, of the early
part of the century, is further remarkable as indicative of
a perception of the growing needs of the world, and an
unconscious foreshadowing of a culture as yet afar off.
And this is broadly the character of the seventeenth
century in Italy, a poor and barren time if paralleled
with the past, but pregnant with the seeds of future
harvests, repressed for a time by ungenial circumstances.
Comparing the Italian literature of the seventeenth century
with that of England and France, we see that all
ran through substantially the same stages, but that, while
these are vigorous alike in their aberrations and their
reforms, Italian literature is languid in both, a circumstance
sufficiently accounted for by its absolute enslavement,

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>The eighteenth century was a period of recovery for
Italy. The ancient lustre of literature, indeed, was but
feebly rekindled; and fine art, with the exception of
music, which rose to unexampled heights, sank lower
and lower. But an invigorating breath pervaded the
nation; men wrote and thought in comparative freedom;
and if pedantry and frivolity still reigned in many
quarters, the sway of outrageous bad taste had departed.
Political and spiritual tyranny were still enthroned, and
religion and politics could only be handled with great
caution; yet reform was more hardy and oppression less
assured than of yore. Italy rose slowly from her abasement,
like a trodden flower resuming its erect attitude,
bruised but not crushed, feeble but not inanimate, obeying
a natural impulse by which she could not fail to right
herself in time.</p>

<p>The chief cause of Italian regeneration, so far as
peculiar to the country, and unconnected with that
general movement towards liberty and toleration which,
originating in England, was gradually transforming
Europe, was the disappearance of the Spanish dominion,
which had for two centuries inflicted every political and
spiritual evil upon Italy without conferring a single benefit
in return. A Spanish dynasty did, indeed, in 1734<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
re-establish itself in the Two Sicilies, but no longer a
dynasty of viceroys; it regarded itself as Italian, and
was served by Italian administrators. Lombardy slumbered
under the comparatively benign sway of Austria.
There was as yet little patriotic resentment against foreign
domination as such; Austria was inert and unaggressive,
and Italy’s princes and people felt conscious of a great
deliverance. It was no time for violent intellectual exercise,
but for quiet and gradual revival. The convalescing
country could not be expected to vie with the intellectual
development of England and France, but her progress
was in the same direction. Within the Alps, as beyond
them, the age, save in music, was unimaginative. It
created little, but brought much to light. Its most
potent intellects, the Kants, Lessings, Diderots, Butlers,
Humes, were turned towards criticism or moral science.
So it was in Italy, where the current of the most powerful
thought ran strongly in the direction of history and
jurisprudence, state reform and public economy. Vico,
Giannone, Beccaria, Filangieri, Genovesi, Galiani are its
representatives. Closely allied to these, but devoid of
their originality, are the investigators of the past and
the critical lawgivers of their own day, the Muratoris,
Crescimbenis, Maffeis, Mazzuchellis, and Tiraboschis.
Nor must the academical movement be left out of sight,
which, if impotent to create good literature, at all events
kept its traditions alive. Lastly, the development of
music reacted on the lyrical drama, which kindled the
other branches of the dramatic art into activity, and
for a time made the Italian drama, tragic, comic, and
operatic, the most interesting in Europe.</p>

<p>Among the philosophical writers who conferred so
much distinction upon Italy in the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
the first, both in order of time and of importance, was
G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> V<small>ICO</small>, a Neapolitan (1668-1744).
Vico’s life was uneventful. He devoted his youth to
the study of metaphysics and Roman law, spent some
happy years in a tutorship in the country, and, returning
to Naples, passed the remainder of his life in a conflict
with poverty, deriving most of his income from adulating
the great in complimentary verses. A small professorship
of rhetoric eked out this precarious means of subsistence,
and when the Spanish dynasty supplanted the Austrian
in 1734, Charles III. conferred a pension upon him, but
the aged philosopher was already sinking into a condition
of imbecility. It seems surprising that he should
have been able to publish so many important and far
from remunerative books.</p>

<p>Vico’s fame rests less upon any particular achievement
than upon the general impression which he produces as a
man greatly in advance of his age. His superiority in
almost every branch of investigation except physical
science, of which he knew little, arises from his unflinching
application of a principle which he was almost
the first of moderns to recognise, that man is to be
viewed collectively. All individuals, all societies, all
sciences, are thus concatenated and regarded as diverse
aspects of a single all-comprehending unity. As a metaphysician
and a jurist, Vico’s claims to attention are very
high, but do not properly fall within our scope. They
are fully set forth by Professor Flint in his volume on
Vico in Blackwood’s Philosophical Classics. We can
only treat of Vico where he comes into contact with
history and literary criticism, as he does very remarkably
in his criticisms upon Roman history and upon
Homer. His investigations into Roman jurisprudence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
showed him the untruth of the traditions of the Twelve
Tables, and starting from this point, he anticipated almost
everything subsequently brought forward by Niebuhr,
although from his deficiency in exact philological knowledge
his arguments were less conclusive. His scepticism
respecting Homer was also the result of speculation;
before the ballads of the mediæval period had been compared
with the Homeric poems, he pronounced on the
internal evidence of the latter, that they must be the
work, not of a man, but of a nation. In both departments
he may have gone too far, but his views are
the divinations of an extraordinary genius. They are
intimately connected with his speculations on history,
which anticipate the general drift of modern thought
by tending to put nations into the place of individuals,
and to represent history as the product of an inevitable
sequence of development. These views greatly influenced
Herder and Turgot, and, through them, Europe.
Vico’s doctrine of the three stages through which human
society passes was used, if it was not plagiarised, by
Comte and Schelling.</p>

<p>Another great Neapolitan writer of the age, though
working on a much smaller scale than Vico, attracted
more notice from contemporaries, inasmuch as Vico
seemed to deal merely with abstract things, while
P<small>IETRO</small> G<small>IANNONE</small> came into rough contact with vested
interests. Giannone, born at Ischitella, in Apulia, May
1676, went to the Neapolitan bar, and made the legal
and ecclesiastical history of the kingdom his especial
study. In his Civil History of the Kingdom of Naples
(1723), the work of twenty years, he demonstrated the
illegitimacy of the Papal claims to jurisdiction over
Naples, with a learning and research which, now that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
these claims are no longer heard of, maintain his works
in request as one of the highest authorities upon mediæval
law. The more ordinary qualities of a historian
are not manifested in the same measure, but Giannone’s
place is something quite apart. The book was received
with gratitude and delight by the educated part of the
public; but the monks, secretly prompted by the court
of Rome, raised an outcry against Giannone as an unbeliever
in St. Januarius, and he was compelled to fly
the country. He found refuge successively in Vienna,
Venice, and Geneva; but having been tempted into
Savoy for the purpose of attending the Roman Catholic
service, was seized and most iniquitously imprisoned by
the King of Sardinia, the King Charles of Browning’s
drama, until his death in 1748, though he maintained all
the time an amicable correspondence with the King and
his minister D’Ormea. Notwithstanding the wrongs
which he suffered from the house of Savoy, he foresaw
and foretold its greatness and service to the nation. He
imitated Machiavelli by exhorting the Italians to military
discipline, and his principal work is epoch-making
as a precursor of the great movement which tended
to subject the Church to the civil power in the latter
half of the eighteenth century. He also composed the
<em>Triregno</em>, a review of the temporal power of the Church
in general, which was so effectually sequestrated as to
have remained unpublished until 1895. It is not quite
complete. Giannone’s autobiography, which comes down
to a late period of his captivity, was published for the
first time in 1891.</p>

<p>Giannone is rather a jurist than an historian, and the
writers whose affinity to him is closest are not historians
like Denina, but the legists and economists, Beccaria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
Filangieri, Genovesi, Galiani. Three of these distinguished
men were Neapolitans, a circumstance significant
alike of the lively genius of the people, and of the
liberality of the government under Charles the Third
and his enlightened minister Tanucci. The spirit of the
Renaissance seemed to have returned in some measure;
but the drift was not now to the classical art and the
literature that had effected the spiritual emancipation
of the former age, but to new theories of human rights
and duties, and to the removal of restrictions from civic
action and social intercourse. There probably never was
a time since the age of Marcus Aurelius when philosophers
attained nearer to royalty than in the age of
Frederick and Catherine, and, were not vaster issues at
stake than the improvement of human institutions, the
same kind of regret might be felt at the French Revolution
which some have expressed for the Reformation as
a premature movement, destructive of safe and moderate
reform.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the human spirit at both epochs
needed regeneration; to have perpetuated the eighteenth-century
type, admirable as this is in many respects, would
have denoted consent to dwell in decencies for ever.
C<small>ESARE</small> B<small>ECCARIA</small> (1738-94) and G<small>AETANO</small> F<small>ILANGIERI</small>
(175-287) were nevertheless great reformers, who, the
former in his <em>Dei Delitti delle Pene</em> (1763), the latter
in his <em>Scienza della Legislazione</em> (1783), contributed
greatly to overthrow mediæval notions of justice, and
to infuse a humane spirit into legislation, not merely by
the abolition of revolting and atrocious penalties, but
by proposing the reformation of the criminal as a chief
object of the lawgiver. This was the especial mission
of Beccaria, who also introduced a very important prin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span>ciple
by his clear separation of the legislative and the
judicial functions. Filangieri combats in particular the
excessive interference of governments, while he foreshadows
the logic and simplicity of a universal code
in the future, realised in some measure by the Code
Napoleon. A<small>NTONIO</small> G<small>ENOVESI</small> (1712-69), the first to
show the necessity of Italian unity, besides making
important contributions to ethics and metaphysics, expounded
freedom of trade and the laws that govern
prices, in his <em>Lezioni di Commercio, o sia d’Economia Civile</em>.
Free trade in corn had also a powerful champion in
the witty Abate F<small>ERDINANDO</small> G<small>ALIANI</small> (1728-87), whose
most important works, however, were written in French.
Galiani adorned the circles of the encyclopædist philosophers
at Paris, whose views on many points he soundly
refuted, and who avenged themselves by comparing the
explosive little Neapolitan to a pantomime incarnate.
His discourse upon trade in corn was speedily translated
into Italian, and gave him rank as an Italian classic;
the best known of his vernacular writings is probably his
humorous account of the alarm created by an eruption
of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>After this group of economists&mdash;to whom the historian
P<small>IETRO</small> V<small>ERRI</small> may be added&mdash;should be recorded another
of literary historians, eminently useful though not
brilliant writers, and consummate men of letters. Of
G<small>IOVANNI</small> M<small>ARIO</small> C<small>RESCIMBENI</small>, the historian of Italian
poetry, we shall have to speak in mentioning the Arcadian
Academy, which he so largely contributed to found and
maintain. He may be justly termed a pedant, but neither
his book nor himself can be spared from Italian literary
history. A much greater name is L<small>ODOVICO</small> A<small>NTONIO</small>
M<small>URATORI</small> (1672-1745), but his imperishable monument
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
was raised not as author but as editor. The publication
of twenty-seven folio volumes of mediæval Italian
historians displays a man singly equal to many learned
societies. No one has stamped his name more deeply
on the historical literature of his country than he has
done by this publication, by his <em>Antiquitates Italicæ
Medii Ævi</em>, and by his <em>Annali</em> from the Christian
era to 1749. One of his original writings has an abiding
place in literature, the <em>Della perfetta Poesia</em>, which
indicates the high-water mark of good taste at the time
of its publication. The affected style of the preceding
century was then entirely out of fashion. On the
negative side Muratori’s taste is almost faultless, and he
often manifests great discrimination in the appreciation
of exquisite beauties. Unfortunately he is all for the
delicate and graceful, and has little feeling for the really
great, of which the Italy of the eighteenth century saw
hardly so much as the counterfeit until, late in the
secular period, Cesarotti produced his version of Ossian.
Muratori venerates Dante rather than admires him; like
Confucius, he respects the gods, but keeps them at a
distance.</p>

<p>The learning and industry of Muratori were almost
rivalled by Count S<small>CIPIONE</small> M<small>AFFEI</small> (1675-1755), the
sovereign of contemporary Italian, almost of European
archæologists, author of the famous tragedy of
<em>Merope</em> and of the equally famed <em>Verona Illustrata</em>; and
by Count Giovanni Maria Mazzuchelli (1707-65), who
should have been the biographer-general of Italian men
of letters, but who began his work on too large a scale for
completion. G<small>IROLAMO</small> T<small>IRABOSCHI</small> (1731-94), librarian
of the Duke of Modena, is the standard Italian literary
historian. His great work has immortalised his name;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
it will nevertheless disappoint those who resort to it in
the expectation of encountering a history on the modern
plan. It is not, strictly speaking, so much a history of
literature as a history of learning. The fortunes of schools
and universities, the rise and decay of particular branches
of study, are narrated very fully, while there is little literary
criticism, and the lives of great men are recounted
with astonishing brevity, except when some personal or
intellectual circumstance regarding them has become
the theme of erudite controversy, when the incident
overshadows the life. One of the most potent literary
influences of the age was the <em>Giornale de’ Letterati</em>,
founded early in the century by Apostolo Zeno, which
long served as a rallying-point for Italian literary
men.</p>

<p>The number of historical works published in Italy
during the eighteenth century was considerable, but
they are chiefly monographs on local history, and, unless
Verri’s history of Lombardy be an exception,
none gained the author the character of a philosophical
historian save C<small>ARLO</small> D<small>ENINA’S</small> <em>Rivoluzioni d’Italia</em>
(1768-72), a work so superior to the writer’s other performances
that it has been doubted whether he really
wrote it. A valuable history of another description
was produced by the ex-Jesuit L<small>UIGI</small> L<small>ANZI</small> (1732-1811),
also celebrated as an Etruscan scholar, in his <em>Storia
Pittorica dell’ Italia</em>, long ago superseded by more accurate
research, but excellent for the time. Art criticism
was promoted by F<small>RANCESCO</small> A<small>LGAROTTI</small> (1712-1764),
chamberlain and friend of Frederick the Great,
Carlyle’s “young Venetian gentleman of elegance in
dusky skin and very while linen,” a most voluminous
writer, “who,” says the unmusical Carlyle, “took up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
the opera in earnest manner as capable of being a
school of virtue and the moral sublime,” but whose
chief title to fame is rather his popular exposition
of the physics of Newton, a modest but meritorious
service. Two miscellaneous writers deserve considerable
attention. One is G<small>IUSEPPE</small> B<small>ARETTI</small> (1719-86),
“a wonderful, wild, coarse, tender, angry creature,”
says Vernon Lee; endeared to Englishmen as the
friend of Johnson and of Reynolds, and the imitator
of the <em>Spectator</em> in his <em>Frusta Litteraria</em>, although an
Ishmael whose hand was against every contemporary,
and who carried personality to lengths which Addison
would have highly disapproved. The most entertaining
of his writings are his lively letters from Spain
and Portugal. The other is G<small>ASPARE</small> G<small>OZZI</small> (1715-86),
brother of the famous dramatist, who also imitated
the <em>Spectator</em> in a periodical, wrote excellent stories in
prose and verse, and rendered a durable service to
literature by his defence of Dante against the aspersions
of Bettinelli, preluding the Dantesque revival of the
next century.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with this development of moral
and economical science, another active movement went
on which created far more agitation among Italian
literati, and which, if it scarcely enriched the national
literature with a single work of merit, at all events kept
up the tradition of poetry. This was the universal itch
for rhyming which seized upon the nation about the
beginning of the eighteenth century, and dates from
the foundation of the Arcadian Academy in 1692. This
epoch-making event is related with unsurpassable verve
in the brilliant pages of Vernon Lee, who rekindles for
us the chief lights of the institution and the time: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
frigid and sardonic, but really illustrious jurist Gravina,
instructor of Montesquieu and of the Academy; the
uncouth pedant but excellent administrator Crescimbeni,
whose history of Italian poetry is a more valuable book
than Vernon Lee allows; the fluent versifiers, not without
gleams of a genuine poetical vein, Rolli and Frugoni;
the marvellous improvisatore Perfetti, a sounding brass,
but no tinkling cymbal, who actually received in the
Capitol the crown awarded to Petrarch and designed
for Tasso.</p>

<p>The seriousness with which these Alfesibeo Carios
and Opico Erimanteos took themselves, their crooks
and their wigs, is astonishing. But they got accepted
at their own valuation, and none disputed their claims
as the sovereign arbiters of elegant literature until,
about 1760, Giuseppe Baretti arose to demonstrate
that, as shepherds, they must be the representatives of
the ancient Scythians. Settembrini in our own day
rather opines that they were created by the Jesuits, just
as the Cobbett of the <em>Rejected Addresses</em> denounces “the
gewgaw fetters of rhyme, invented by the monks in the
Middle Ages to enslave the people.” Every city in
Italy had its offshoot of the Arcadia; every member
did something to approve his literary taste, were it
but one of the hundred and fifty elegies, in all manner
of languages, on the decease of Signor Balestrieri’s
cat (1741). The result was a deluge of insipid verse,
preferable at any rate to the extravagance of the preceding
century.</p>

<p>Two Arcadians alone evinced real poetical talent, the
two Zappis of Imola. F<small>ELICE</small> Z<small>APPI</small> wrought on a small
scale, but with exquisite perfection. His sonnets, madrigals,
and lyrical trifles generally are among the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span>
choicest examples of Italian minor poetry for elegance,
<em>esprit</em>, and melody. It is true that he exposed himself to
the merciless ridicule of Baretti by dreaming that he
stood upon his hind legs and barked madrigals in the
character of his lady’s lap-dog, but this lapse ought not
to count against his genuine merits. His wife, Faustina,
formerly Maratti, is more ambitious but less consummate.
Her writings are nevertheless always estimable, and one
sonnet is remarkable for an energy and vehemence sped
straight from the heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Lady, on whom my Lord was wont to gaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Complacent so, that oft unto mine ear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thy abundant tress and aspect clear</span><br />
And silvery speech he yet resounds the praise;<br />
Tell me, when thou to him discourse didst raise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed he, immersed in musing, not to hear?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, as to me may chance, did look austere,</span><br />
And moody frown his countenance deface?<br />
Time was, I know, when passionate and weak<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But ah! what blushes mantle on thy cheek!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Answer, I pray thee&mdash;no! hush! never speak</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thou wouldst tell me that he loves thee still!</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">All the minor Italian versifiers were speedily eclipsed
by the genius of Metastasio, whose place, however, is
with dramatic poets. But for him, the eighteenth century
wore away without producing a poet of great mark,
until, in 1763, Italy was startled by the appearance of
the <em>Mattina</em>, the first part of the <em>Giorno</em> of G<small>IUSEPPE</small>
P<small>ARINI</small>. Parini is particularly interesting as the first
eminent Italian poet who shows decided traces of English
influence. The plan of his poem is taken from
Thomson, the spirit is the spirit of Pope; the net result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
is much such a poem as Cowper might have written had
he been an Italian. Just as Thomson in his <em>Seasons</em>
depicts the entire course of Nature from four points
of view, so Parini in his <em>Giorno</em> delineates the useless
life of a frivolous young Italian of quality by exhibiting
the occupations of his morning, afternoon, evening,
and night. The spirit is that of Pope’s satires, but
Parini, composing in blank verse, has been led into a
style more nearly resembling that of Young, although
he has little of the sententious abruptness of the
<em>Night Thoughts</em> or of their fatiguing glitter: the four
poems are perfect wholes, gliding from theme to theme
by the most ingenious and delicate transitions, and replete
with charming episodes; the diction is exquisite,
and the blank verse the best that Italy had then
seen. The work is invaluable as a picture of manners,
and a masterpiece of delicate polished satire; the
<em>jeunesse dorée</em> of Milan is or ought to be made
thoroughly ashamed of the vapidity of its existence,
but every phrase is urbane, and all the ridicule dainty
and ironical. The subject is hardly susceptible of
high poetry, but Parini has adorned it as only a poet
could. The composition of the remaining three parts
occupied him for many years, and the last two are
not quite complete. His minor pieces reveal the same
remarkable power as the <em>Giorno</em> of elevating trifling
circumstances into the region of poetry. One sonnet
especially is worthy of the Greek Anthology in finish
and charm of invention:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Benignant Sleep, that on soft pinion sped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dost wing through darkling night thy noiseless way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fleeting multitudes of dreams display</span><br />
To weariness reposed on quiet bed:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span><br />
Go where my Phillis doth her gentle head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blooming cheek on peaceful pillow lay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And while the body sleeps, the soul affray</span><br />
With dismal shape from thy enchantment bred.<br />
So like unto mine own that form be made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pallor so dim disfiguring its face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she may waken by compassion swayed.</span><br />
If this thou wilt accomplish of thy grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A double wreath of poppies I will braid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And silently upon thine altar place.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Parini, “a poor sickly priest,” led an uneventful life in
Milan until the overthrow of Austrian rule by the French
invasion, when he came forward prominently in public
affairs, and earned credit by his good sense and moderation.
He died in 1799, aged seventy. He was a high-minded
man of austere morality.</p>

<p>Another poet of the eighteenth century deserves no less
fame than Parini, but has remained comparatively unknown
from having written in dialect. It is his compensation
to be as decidedly at the head of the Sicilian
lyrists as Petrarch is at the head of the Tuscan; nor is
Sicilian in any degree a rude or barbarous idiom. Schools
of Sicilian poetry existed in the thirteenth, and again in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but all previous
celebrities were eclipsed by the brilliant achievements of
G<small>IOVANNI</small> M<small>ELI</small> (1740-1815). Meli can hardly be paralleled
either with Burns or with our English Theocritus,
William Barnes, for he possesses neither Burns’s tragic
pathos and withering satire, nor Barnes’s power of realistic
description. But he rivals Burns in simplicity and melody,
and is capable of much loftier lyric flights than Barnes;
and if his satire does not brand or scathe, it smiles and
sparkles with genial humour. The lightness, ease, and
grace of his songs cannot be exceeded; his pastorals are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
worthy of a countryman of Theocritus; and his mock-heroics,
<em>Don Quixote</em>, and the <em>Origin of the World</em>, though
evincing less of poetical inspiration, are effluences of
genuine humour. His employment of the Sicilian dialect
was highly favourable to his genius by exempting him
from all obligation to write with academical constraint.
It is most interesting to find Wordsworth’s plea for a
return to nature anticipated by a Sicilian of the generally
stiff and affected eighteenth century. One of the most
marked features of his poetry is its lively and dramatic
character, arising from the close observation of national
types, apparently just as they were observed by the
ancient writers of Sicilian mimes, Sophron and Epicharmus.
“As in antiquity,” says Paul Heyse, “so at
this day, idyll, song, and mime are the species of poetical
composition allotted as the Sicilian heritage.” Meli represented
the national genius to perfection. His life was
uneventful. He is represented as an amiable, sensible,
unassuming man, as much of a Bacchus as consistent
with sobriety, and as much of an Anacreon as comported
with an utter ignorance of Greek, an <em>abate</em> of the old
school, attached, but not in a perverse or bigoted manner,
to the ancient social order, which, by the aid of British
ships and troops, maintained itself better in Sicily than
elsewhere in Italy.</p>

<p>The licentious poems of the Abate G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small>
C<small>ASTI</small> (1721-1803) deserve attention from their influence
on Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em>, and also from the veiled political
character of many of them. Casti, an accomplished
traveller and acquainted with many distinguished men,
belongs, like Talleyrand, both to the old time and to the
new. Attached by habit and taste to the polished and
frivolous society of the ancient régime, his sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
were nevertheless liberal. He satirised Catherine the
Second, and when exiled from Vienna on that account,
had the spirit to resign his Austrian pension. The
<em>Animali Parlanti</em> a satire upon the rule of the stronger
in political life, and thus an interesting revival of
the old conception of Reynard the Fox, is his best
work.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the age of Richardson and
Fielding in England, and Marivaux and Prevost d’Exiles
in France, should have produced no novelist of reputation
in Italy. The imitation of even such world-famed
books as the <em>Nouvelle Héloise</em> and <em>Werther</em> was reserved
for a later generation. One romancer acquired some
celebrity&mdash;Count A<small>LESSANDRO</small> V<small>ERRI</small> (1741-1816), who
hit upon, or borrowed from Wieland, the idea of resorting
for his themes to antiquity. His <em>Notti Romane</em>,
<em>Saffo</em>, and <em>Erostrato</em> are all works of merit, and the
first-named was probably not without influence upon
Landor.</p>

<p>On the whole, the history of the Italy of the eighteenth
century is in most departments, intellectual and political,
that of a patient recovering from a formidable malady by
slow but certain stages. Much is lost, never to return.
The relation of Italy to the rest of Europe is no longer
that of Athens to Sparta or Bœotia, as in the sixteenth
century; but neither, as in the seventeenth, is she estranged
from the general current of European thought.
Her intellectual position may be read in the very portraits
of her eminent men, who in general display the
placid eighteenth-century type, and might as well have
been Frenchmen or Englishmen as Italians. They were
writers of signal merit and utility, but, Vico excepted,
not men of creative genius, and the national mind might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
easily have degenerated into mediocrity but for the
tremendous convulsions of the end of the century. In
one province, however, she stood apart and supreme
during nearly the whole of the age&mdash;the drama, with
or without musical accompaniment, which must form
the subject of our next chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>THE COMEDY OF MASKS&mdash;THE OPERA&mdash;DRAMA<br />
OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>The eighteenth century, if chiefly remarkable in Italian
literary history for the dawn of national regeneration,
and the assimilation of literature to the type prevailing
in other European countries, is also memorable as the
period when Italian dramatists first acquired a European
renown. This recognition may be considered to
date from the production of Count Maffei’s <em>Merope</em> in
1714, and from the summons of Apostolo Zeno to Vienna
a few years afterwards. These two men represented,
one, the classical tragedy, which, notwithstanding its
conventional acceptance, has ever remained an exotic
in Italy; the other, that special creation of Italian
genius, the musical play or opera. Later in the century,
Alfieri and Metastasio carried both forms nearer to perfection,
and Goldoni gave his country a comedy at once
brilliant and regular. Yet the genuine dramatic life of
the nation is to be found in the <em>commedia dell’ arte</em>, or
Comedy of Masks, contemned by the learned, but dear
to the people, which, except for a brief interval in the
hands of Carlo Gozzi, failed to clothe itself with literary
form, but has pervaded the theatres of Europe in
the costume of harlequin, columbine, and pantaloon.</p>

<p>As the simplest, the <em>commedia dell’ arte</em> is probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span>
the oldest form of the drama. There can be no question
that the Greek rustics who smeared their faces with
wine-lees at the Dionysiac festivals, and from whose
improvised songs and gestures Greek comedy was developed,
virtually enacted the same parts as the Tuscan
and Neapolitan peasants, who, inheriting this rude entertainment
from Roman times, preserved it through the
Middle Ages, until it assumed new importance in the
general awakening of the sixteenth century. The original
wine-lees gave place to masks, and as masks cannot be
varied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, the characters became limited to a
few well-defined and salient types. Hence every piece
had substantially the same personages; although the
Italian comedy allows of numerous variations upon its
four stock parts. This caused the dialogue to be mainly
extemporaneous; and as comedy is more easily extemporised
than tragedy, the pieces tended more and more
towards farce. At the same time, “the fertility of fancy,
quickness of intelligence, facility of utterance, command
of language, and presence of mind,” indispensable to a
good impromptu comedian, bestowed a certain regularity
upon the performance. The actor was obliged to observe
the conditions imposed by the character he represented,
conventional as this was: if he enacted Pantaloon, he
must not comport himself as Brighella or the Doctor,
and <em>vice versâ</em>. As in the Indian drama, the comic passages
were usually in dialect; the serious, if any, in cultivated
language. Despised as literature, these pieces
attained great popularity even beyond the limits of Italy,
especially in Paris, where they divided public favour with
the national theatre for a hundred and fifty years. As,
however, they were mainly improvised, and no care was
taken of such parts as might chance to be written down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
they have virtually perished. No literary relic of their
palmy days seems to exist except the <em>scenarios</em> or skeleton
plans of some of them, mere outlines to be filled up by
the performers. Modern readers will hardly obtain a
better idea of their spirit than from Vernon Lee’s inimitable
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prince of the Hundred Soups</i>, a fantastic tale laid in
the seventeenth century, the culminating period of these
dramatic impromptus, towards the close of which they
began to yield to the musical drama. Their capability
of real dramatic excellence is revealed by two more
recent developments&mdash;the improved Pulcinello farces of
F<small>RANCESCO</small> C<small>ERLONE</small>, a Neapolitan tailor, who, in the
later half of the eighteenth century, “lifted,” says
Scherillo, “Pulcinello from the crowd of masks, and
made him the monarch of the popular theatre”; and
the fairy dramas of Carlo Gozzi, a Venetian of the same
period. Both usually wrote their plays out, or at least
left comparatively little to the invention of the actors;
but Cerlone composed entirely in the spirit of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">commedia
dell’ arte</i>. His Pulcinello is commonly a butt,
designed to keep the audience throughout in a roar of
laughter by his ridiculous adventures, an object most
fully attained. Gozzi’s pieces are of higher literary
quality, and demand a more particular notice.</p>

<p>C<small>ARLO</small> G<small>OZZI</small> (1720-1808), brother of Gaspare Gozzi,
already mentioned, would merit an honourable place
among Italian writers merely on the strength of his entertaining
memoirs, translated by Symonds. His real
significance in literary history, however, is confined to
the four brilliant years in which he carried all before
him on the Venetian stage by his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiabe</i> or dramatised
fairy tales, composed in the spirit of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">commedia dell’
arte</i>, in so far that many of the characters belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
the old conventional types, and that a portion of the
action was highly farcical. These characteristics were
nevertheless combined with a regular plot capable of
exciting deep interest. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiabe</i> originated in a literary
quarrel. Goldoni, the restorer of true comedy to Italy,
had denounced the buffooneries of the old <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">commedia
dell’ arte</i>, and Gozzi, who had himself cultivated that
form, and whose partiality for it was enhanced by a
misunderstanding with Goldoni, determined to show its
capabilities, and at the same time to ridicule his dramatic
rivals, Goldoni and the Abate Chiari. To this end he
hit upon the extremely happy idea of dramatising the
fairy tales in Basile’s <em>Pentamerone</em>, thus creating a form
represented in English literature by the admirable burlesques
of Planché, but with even more resemblance to
an ancient form of which no complete example remains,
the mythological parodies of the Attic Middle Comedy,
which combined ridicule of the tragic poets with a regular
plot derived from ancient tradition.</p>

<p>In the <em>scenario</em> of his <em>Three Oranges</em>, a play not preserved
in its entirety, Gozzi has explained how he burlesqued
his rivals, as, for instance, when the long journeys which
Chiari’s personages are supposed to perform within the
compass of a single action are ridiculed by Tartaglia
and Truffaldino being propelled two thousand leagues
by the devil with a pair of bellows. (“They sprawled
on the grass at the sudden cessation of the favouring
gale.”) The success of the <em>Three Oranges</em> was immense,
and contributed to drive Goldoni from Venice. It was
followed by a rapid succession of similar pieces, tending,
however, to assume more of a literary character, and
become more and more remote from the original type of
the Comedy of Masks. This, if diminishing their value as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
illustrations of popular manners and sentiment, renders
them more generally enjoyable; and they would have
a wide European reputation were they not principally
composed in the Venetian dialect. <em>Turandot</em>, in the
translation, or rather imitation, of Schiller, is known
wherever German literature extends; but the scarcely
inferior merits of the <em>Blue Monster</em>, the <em>Green Bird</em>, and
the like, have not in general induced foreigners to learn
the Venetian patois.</p>

<p>Gozzi, in truth, just missed greatness; he had the
artistic talent to work out a clever idea, but not the
poetical fancy requisite to elevate this lo a region of
ideal beauty. As suggested by Symonds, his pieces
would supply excellent material for operatic libretti.
Tieck subsequently undertook the task with higher
qualifications, but the favourable moment had gone by.
Gozzi’s plays are the true offspring of the national
spirit, Tieck’s merely importations. After four years
of brilliant triumphs, Gozzi slopped short, fearing to
fatigue the public taste, or conscious of having exhausted
his vein. The remainder of his career as a
dramatic author was chiefly occupied with adaptations
from the Spanish.</p>

<p>While in the later seventeenth and early eighteenth
century the Comedy of Masks was decaying, a new
form of drama was silently growing up, the operatic,
“a thing,” says Vernon Lee, “born of scenic displays
and concerts, moulded into a romantic, wholly original
shape, by the requirements of scenery, music, and
singing.” Its character as a literary production is
indicated by the fact that its proper title of <em>melodrama</em>
has become synonymous with something quite different,
the prose tragedy which aims at strong sensational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
situations, while <em>melodramatic</em> evokes no association with
music.</p>

<p>The chief representatives of new literary forms are
frequently heralded by precursors, who, if serving in
some sense as foils to their genius, yet deprive them of
the praise of absolute originality. What Phrynichus was
to Æschylus, and Marlowe to Shakespeare, A<small>POSTOLO</small>
Z<small>ENO</small> (1668-1750), a Venetian of Candiote extraction,
was to P<small>IETRO</small> M<small>ETASTASIO</small>. It was not Metastasio but
Zeno who gave the musical drama literary rank, and
proved that poets as well as musicians might make their
reputations and their fortunes by it. Zeno produced
his first serious attempt in musical drama in 1695, and
long held the position of chief dramatic poet of Italy.
After founding and for many years conducting the influential
<em>Giornale de’ Letterati</em>, he became court poet at
Vienna in 1718, and eleven years afterwards retired
voluntarily in favour of the rising Metastasio, who
completely eclipsed him on the stage, but could not
deprive him of the honour of having first taught Italy
how dramatic poetry of a high order might be associated
with music. Zeno, moreover, was no mere playwright,
but a good lyrical poet with a strong dramatic instinct,
a scholar, moreover, and antiquary, and a renowned
collector of medals. His last years were spent in honour
and comfort at his native Venice. Ere his life terminated
in 1750 the productiveness of his successor had almost
come to an end.</p>

<p>Metastasio’s long prosperous life was not destitute of
romance. The son (born 1698) of a petty Neapolitan
druggist settled at Rome, he was adopted by the famous
jurist and excellent dramatic critic Gravina, who had
heard him singing in the street, for although at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
time an inglorious, he was fortunately not a mute Milton.
Victor Cousin was similarly snatched from the gutter, for
different issues and from different motives. His sonorous
appellative was the gift of his patron, who Hellenised
his protégé’s original name of Trapassi, and left him a
fortune. After wasting most of his benefactor’s legacy,
Metastasio articled himself to a Neapolitan lawyer
named Castagnola, who received him on condition
that he should not even read, much less write, a line
of verse. This pledge was broken by the composition
in 1722 of the <em>Gardens of the Hesperides</em>, a little mask
composed under compulsion from the Austrian viceroy.
The secret of the authorship was ferreted out by La
Romanina, the celebrated <em>cantatrice</em>, who pounced
upon Metastasio, bore him from Castagnola’s house to
her own, and made him a dramatic poet. She was
a married woman much older than Metastasio, and
there seems no suggestion that her affection was other
than maternal. It ended, however, unhappily, perhaps
tragically.</p>

<p>The immense success of his <em>Didone Abbandonata</em>, performed
at Rome in 1723, and followed by a number
of similar pieces, had made Metastasio the undisputed
sovereign of the lyric stage, and in 1730 he was invited
to Vienna to replace the veteran Zeno. He went. La
Romanina wished to follow, but never did, and died
very suddenly in 1734. Had Metastasio, now devoted
to Countess Althan, to whom he is said to have been
privately married, obstructed her journey? and was her
death natural? There is nothing but surmise as to the
precise nature of the case; but Vernon Lee’s tragical
summing-up is true as a statement of fact: “Thus
ended the romance of Metastasio’s life, and with it his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span>
youth, and soon after his hope and his genius.” His
Vienna period between 1730 and 1740 was artistically
the most brilliant of his life, but he wrote little afterwards;
though his dramas long monopolised the Italian
lyric stage; and the decline of his productive power
seems to have been chiefly owing to the untoward
interruption to dramatic performances occasioned by
the Austrian war of succession in 1740 and following
years. When peace returned, Metastasio had become
nervous and hypochondriacal; he yet gained his culminating
triumph with the <em>Atilio Regolo</em> in 1750, and the
later half of his life, which ended in 1782, was embellished
by his friendship with the Italian singer-statesman,
Farinelli. Metastasio was selfish, but not cold-hearted;
he pined for affection, but shrank from self-sacrifice;
and his self-regarding instinct was not ennobled by
devotion to any of the causes or pursuits which inspired
Goethe. Yet he was a connoisseur in virtue, and his
dramas represent her in some of her most attractive
shapes. He saw forty editions of his works in his own
library; he had not only accumulated but had refused
distinctions; if he could feel free from blame towards
La Romanina, there was nothing with which he needed
to reproach himself. His life had been a continual
triumph; no wonder if he had become weary of it at
last.</p>

<p>Operatic success requires two endowments rarely
united in the same person, the ingenuity of a playwright
and the melody of a nightingale. Both these are combined
in Metastasio; he is a very Scribe for briskness,
deftness, and clever contrivance of plot; ere he had
become nervous and depressed, his Neapolitan brain
seethed at a dramatic situation; his <em>Achille in Sciro</em>, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
of the best of his pieces, was written, provided with
music and scenery, and thoroughly organised for representation,
within eighteen days. Other Italian librettists
may have rivalled him in tunefulness or in the faculty of
dramatic construction, none in both these respects, and
none have been able to impart the like literary quality to
their compositions; partly because he possessed and
they lacked the indescribable something that makes the
poet; partly because the sentiment which with them is
merely theatrical, is with him sincere.</p>

<p>The general inferiority of operatic libretti has occasioned
the musical drama to be despised as a branch of
literature; although, to say nothing of the recent achievements
of Richard Wagner, the Euripidean play, with
its frequent predominance of solos over choral parts,
approximated to the modern opera. It is no doubt true
that the first requisite is that the words should be a
vehicle for the music, and that, supposing this object
attained, it is feasible to dispense with poetry. It follows
that poetry usually is dispensed with, and that the
only literary gift deemed absolutely indispensable for
opera is that of dramatic construction. It is the great
distinction of Metastasio to have been at the same time
a consummate playwright and a true lyrical poet. Other
great playwrights have been great poets in blank verse;
but, at any rate for the first half of his life, Metastasio’s
bosom was as affluent a storehouse of melody as Rückert’s;
to sing was for him as easy as to speak. He was
constrained to submit himself to the laws of the opera,
inexorable because founded upon the reason of things.
As an opera can be nothing without a <em>cantatrice</em>, it
follows that it must turn chiefly upon the passion of
love; as the principal performers’ throats will not bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>
a perpetual strain, they must necessarily be sometimes
relieved by inferior executants; hence the necessity of
an underplot, and of constructive ability to interweave
this with the main action. As the musical drama is not,
after all, natural, the audience’s attention must be kept
occupied by continual action and bustle; as the singer
must leave the stage at his best, the recitative must be
followed by an air. Such tags must be judged simply
with reference to the musical effect, which with Metastasio
was always very great. On the whole, few writers
have adapted means to ends more successfully than he
has done, or have more completely solved the problem
of investing the amusement of the moment with abiding
literary worth.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of Metastasio’s lyrical dramas are
perhaps the <em>Olimpiade</em>, the <em>Achille in Sciro</em>, the <em>Clemenza
di Tito</em>, and the <em>Atilio Regolo</em>. The <em>Artaserse</em>, the <em>Temistocle</em>,
the <em>Zenobia</em>, have also a high reputation, and in
truth the intervals of merit among his pieces are not
very wide. The operatic dramatist is released from
many of the obligations which press most heavily upon
the tragic or comic poet; he is at liberty to mingle
the manners and ideas of different ages and nations
as much as he pleases; no great profundity of psychological
analysis can be expected from him, for if he
possessed this gift the conditions of his field of art
would debar him from manifesting it. It is enough
if his subject is interesting, his action lively and well
combined, and his melody copious and spontaneous.
Metastasio selected his themes with consummate judgment,
and showed a Scribe-like power of devising bustling
action and sudden surprises, while his tunefulness is
remarkable even for an Italian poet. His pieces would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
have enthralled audiences even without literary charm.
That they retain their place in the library after their
disappearance from the stage proves him a poet as
well as a dramatist. His oratorios resemble his secular
pieces, but are less interesting. His cantatas have
the air of loppings from his dramas. The chief merit
of his other lyrical compositions is their inexhaustible
melody.</p>

<p>The vogue of the lyrical drama under Zeno and Metastasio
was not favourable to the more legitimate forms
of the art. “<em>Ce beau monstre</em>,” said Voltaire, “<em>étouffe
Melpomène</em>.” If so, the Italian drama was stifled, like
Desdemona, in her sleep. The extravagance of the
first half of the seventeenth century had been succeeded
by the torpor of the second, and nothing really
good had been produced in either. It was not until
1713 that a tragedy appeared which deserved and obtained
a European reputation. This was the <em>Merope</em>
of Count Scipione Maffei, whose principal work, his
<em>Verona Illustrata</em>, has already been mentioned, and who,
besides many other claims to distinction, gained an
honourable fame as a natural philosopher, as the critical
historian of chivalric orders, and as the denouncer of
duelling. A man of this stamp, however gifted, was
not likely to be richly endowed with the poetical temperament,
and Maffei’s <em>Merope</em> shares the almost universal
fault of modern tragedies on classical subjects,
it is essentially a work of reflection. It was composed
with the deliberate purpose of retrieving the Italian
drama from its degraded condition, and was the result
of conversations wilh the actor Riccoboni, author of
an esteemed work on the Italian stage, who lamented
that the theatre of his own country afforded him no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
fine parts. The want was well supplied by <em>Merope</em>,
the plot being highly dramatic, and the treatment, in
the opinion of Matthew Arnold, more poetical than that
of either of Maffei’s successors, Voltaire and Alfieri.</p>

<p>Maffei nevertheless was to yield to one of the most extraordinary
men that Italy ever produced, one brought up
under so many disadvantages that it might seem impossible
that he should occupy a high place in the literature
of his country, and who nevertheless, by the mere force
of will and character, has fought his way to almost the
highest in his own field. It must be added that although
Count V<small>ITTORIO</small> A<small>LFIERI</small> (1749-1803) might probably
have been eminent as an historian or a political writer,
tragedy and satire were the only departments of poetry
in which it seems possible that he should have excelled.
This is as much as to say that he was by nature little of
a poet. He was also little of an Italian, being by birth a
Piedmontese, a people whom the Italians of that day
regarded, from an ethnographical point of view, much
as the Greeks of Philip’s day regarded the Macedonians,
and who were in truth destined to work
out the parallel by subduing the rest of the peninsula,
though with very different aims and to very different
results. Alfieri was indeed more like an Englishman
than an Italian, and might well have sat as a model
to some delineator of the haughty, eccentric, whimsical,
misanthropic, hopelessly perverse, but on occasion
extravagantly generous being who is still accepted on
the Continent as the embodiment of British national
character. He did, in fact, belong to a type more
common in England than elsewhere, the patrician republican
of the mould of Algernon Sidney or Savage
Landor, animated by an unaffected passion for liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
and yet arrogant, exacting, domineering; fired by a
disinterested love of man, and always quarrelling with
men.</p>

<p>Alfieri fortunately felt moved to write his <em>Autobiography</em>,
a work of intense interest, and perhaps the most
thoroughly sincere among celebrated books of its order
of literature. It depicts a man continually under the
influence of pride and discontent, but whom pride and
discontent stimulate to lofty endeavour and noble actions.
Vivid indeed is the picture of his self-contempt for his
wasted youth and his ignorance of his own language,
the speech of Piedmont being then the worst of all provincial
jargons. Most interesting is the detail of his self-education,
both in purity of diction and in the dramatic
art. This psychological interest is relieved and enhanced
by the detail of his numerous adventures, his extensive
travels, and his love affairs, three of which were memorable.
In London, in 1772, he fought, by the last rays of
the setting sun, unattended by seconds, a duel with the
injured husband of Lady Ligonier, and wounded in the
right arm, was immediately afterwards back in the theatre
out of which he had been summoned to the fray. His
Milan adventure, if less romantic, was more whimsical:
convinced of the unworthiness of his siren, he imitated
Ulysses by compelling his servant to bind him to his
chair until the craving for her company had passed
away.</p>

<p>Alfieri’s third escapade of the kind is world-famous,
his rescue of Louise von Stolberg, Countess of Albany,
from the drunken husband who habitually maltreated
her, and who, one blushes to record, was no other than
Charles Edward Stuart, the chivalrous and adventurous
Young Pretender of a former generation. Alfieri’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
attachment to the Countess was undoubtedly deep and
permanent, and although she seems to have forgotten
him after his death, she felt for him when he was the
only resource she had in the world. The intimacy might
long have remained Platonic but for the extreme brutality
of Charles Edward, which compelled the Countess
to escape by Alfieri’s contrivance to a convent where she
saw neither her husband nor her lover. After a while
the Cardinal of York, the Pretender’s brother, offered her
an asylum in a Roman palace, where her acquaintance
with Alfieri became more intimate. Afterwards, legally
separated by the interposition of the King of Sweden,
she withdrew to Alsace, where Alfieri followed her. They
eventually established themselves in Paris, and the death
of Charles Edward made no change in their existence.
Louise, though apparently not a warm-hearted, was a
highly intellectual woman; half French, half German,
she possessed a range of knowledge and accomplishment
which Alfieri could hardly have found in any Italian
woman at that date, and her sympathy, without doubt,
contributed greatly to the development of his genius.
Driven from France by the storms of the Revolution,
which he had at first hailed with a warmth which he
afterwards repented, Alfieri settled with his mistress at
Florence. There he wrote the <em>Misogallo</em>, a furious denunciation
of France, and exhausted by hard study and
an ascetic life, died in October 1803, as, with an unconscious
touch of irony, he was compelling himself to
write comedies. There seems no ground for believing
that he was privately married to the Countess, who
honoured him with a monument beautifully sculptured
by Canova. If, however, the mourning figure by the
tomb represents the bereaved one, she has taken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
lion’s share, Alfieri appearing merely as a medallion head
in profile. Room should have been found for a bust
at least, for whimsical, saturnine, arrogant as he was,
he possessed not only a head but a heart. Scornful of
superstition, he was endowed with deep religious feeling,
and the defects of his harsh, angular character were at
all events remote from those national failings which had
chiefly contributed to the ruin of Italy.</p>

<p>It is remarkable indeed that a Piedmontese, who had
to teach himself classical Italian with infinite labour,
and whose character possessed few distinctively national
traits, should have been the reviver of the national spirit
in Italy. This Alfieri unquestionably was. He had what
is so deplorably wanting among the gifted men of the
golden age of Italian literature, a passion for freedom
and a hatred of tyranny, which impart to his works, however
remote in subject from modern times, the air of
indignant protests against the subjection and degradation
of his country. This feeling, as well as the haughty
and self-sufficing independence of his character, brings
him very near to the stoical Romans of the age of Nero,
whose literary productions he approaches by his declamatory
eloquence, his defective feeling for nature, and the
generally studied and laboured character of his poetry.
Had Seneca possessed the leading requisites of a tragic
poet, he would have been a kind of Roman Alfieri.
Comparing Alfieri’s tragedy with the modern form of
the art which owes most to Seneca, the French drama
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we are
sensible of a great advance; not that Alfieri is comparable
as a poet or a stylist to Corneille or Racine,
but that his dramatic economy is improved by the
suppression of much conventional machinery, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
subordination of amorous gallantry to more dignified
and serious emotion.</p>

<p>The strongest family likeness prevails among Alfieri’s
tragedies. “He is,” says Arnold, “a noble-minded, deeply
interesting man, but a monotonous poet.” The quality
of “narrow elevation” which Arnold finds in Alfieri is
indeed most apparent throughout all his plays; but they
are not, like so many productions of the classical school
tame and frigid from pedantic over-correctness, nor are
they untrue to nature through servile adherence to tradition
and convention. Their dignity and nobility of feeling
inspire deep respect; the author is evidently akin to
the heroes he depicts, and in their place would have been
capable of their actions. His genius did not lead him to
the imitation of the Greeks; his plays are rather such as a
Roman poet might have produced if he could have more
completely emancipated himself from Greek models. He
aimed at nervous conciseness, and attained it. The eloquence
which he acquired by a Demosthenic severity of
study may be fitter for the forum than the stage, but rarely
degenerates into mere rhetoric. His theme is always
some grand action derived from history or mythology.
His predilection is rather for the heroes of liberty, like
Timoleon or the Brutuses. <em>Saul</em>, however, is probably
his most successful play upon the whole, though <em>Myrrha</em>
may produce the greatest effect when an actress can be
found competent for so exceptional a part. <em>Philip the
Second</em> inspired Schiller’s <em>Don Carlos</em>. <em>Antigone</em>, <em>Orestes</em>,
and the <em>Conspiracy of the Pazzi</em> may also be named among
Alfieri’s most successful pieces.</p>

<p>Alfieri’s prose-writings possess no great value, except the
<em>Autobiography</em>, which is invaluable alike from the interest
of the character depicted and of the events narrated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
and from its transparent candour. As a rule, the only
quite trustworthy autobiographic delineations are the
unconscious ones. Pepys has undoubtedly portrayed
himself just as he was, but it is equally certain that he
had no intention of doing so. Alfieri may or may not
have depicted himself as he was, although the portrait
is perfectly in harmony with the impression derived from
his writings. But he has unquestionably depicted himself
as he appeared to himself, and more could not be
expected. Alfieri’s minor poems display the “narrow
elevation” ascribed by Matthew Arnold to his tragedies.
He has little music, fancy, or variety, but expresses strong
feeling with unusual energy, especially when moved to
wrath:</p>

<p class="p1">If Alfieri was a manifest child of Melpomene, the third
great dramatic writer of the age bore the impress of
Thalia with no less distinctness. C<small>ARLO</small> G<small>OLDONI’S</small> memoirs
paint with the utmost liveliness the born comedian,
careless, light-hearted, proof by a happy temperament
against all strokes of Fate, yet thoroughly respectable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>
and honourable. Such characters abound in Italy, and
wonderful it is that only one member of so observant
and lively a race should have won an European reputation
as a comic author. Tragedy has in some measure
flourished since the death of Alfieri, but Goldoni still
stands alone. The absence of any predecessor is explicable
from the circumstances enumerated at the beginning
of this chapter: the national style of comedy was
not literary, and no literary reputation could be built
upon or out of it; while those who followed a different
path produced simply academic work devoid of all
vitality. Goldoni broke the spell, and gave Italy a classical
form of comedy, which has not indeed remained
uncultivated, but has never since his time been cultivated
by a master. He was born at Venice in 1707, and was
the son of a physician. His dramatic tastes were inherited
from his grandfather, a Modenese, and all the
endeavours of his parents to direct his activity into other
channels came to nothing. He was indeed educated
for a lawyer, graduated, held at different times a secretaryship
and a councillorship, seemed to have settled
steadily down to the practice of law, when an unexpected
invitation carried him off to Venice, and for years he did
nothing but manage theatres and write plays, directing
all his energies to supersede the national Comedy of
Masks, and comedies of intrigue dependent upon intricacy
of plot, by representations of actual life and
manners. Many of his best plays were written in the
Venetian dialect. At length (1761) umbrage, as was
thought, at the vogue of Gozzi’s fairy dramas induced
Goldoni to accept a royal invitation to Paris, where
he spent the remainder of his life composing plays in
French, and writing his memoirs in the same language.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
He survived the downfall of the monarchy, and died
in 1793, just as the pension of which he had been deprived
was about to be restored to him. The first half
of his life had been full of vicissitudes and entertaining
adventures, agreeably recounted in his memoirs.</p>

<p>The future master of comedy commenced his dramatic
career with a melodrama, <em>Amalasunta</em>, which he burned,
and followed this up with another, of whose success he
afterwards professed himself ashamed. He was not
long, nevertheless, in discovering his proper vocation;
he inwardly, and from his point of view rightly&mdash;for he
could never have been a Gozzi&mdash;declared war against
the popular Comedy of Masks, and when a piece of his
succeeded, whispered to himself, “Good, but not yet
Molière.” The great Frenchman was the object of his
idolatry, and justly, for not only was Molière the true
monarch of the comic stage, but his period was neither
too near nor too remote, and his world neither too like
nor unlike Goldoni’s, for successful imitation. By 1753
Goldoni’s apprenticeship was over, and none but literary
enemies contested his title of the Italian Molière, a title
confirmed by the suffrage of posterity. <em>Un Curioso
Accidente</em>, <em>Il Vero Amico</em>, <em>La Bottega del Caffè</em>, <em>La Locandiera</em>,
and many other comedies that might be named,
while true to the manners of a past age, retain all their
freshness in our own. Italian audiences yet take delight
in his pictures of their ancestors. “One of the best
theatres in Venice,” says Symonds, “is called by his
name. His house is pointed out by gondoliers to
tourists. His statue stands almost within sight of the
Rialto. His comedies are repeatedly given by companies
of celebrated actors.” Yet as Cæsar called Terence a
halved Menander, so we may term Goldoni a halved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span>
Molière. The Menandrine element in Molière is present
with him; the Aristophanic is missing. Goldoni wants
the French writer’s overpowering <em>vis comica</em>, and is
happier in “catching the manners living as they rise”
than in laying bare the depths of the heart. Wit, gaiety,
elegance, simplicity, truth to nature, skill in dramatic
construction, render him nevertheless a most delightful
writer, and his fame is the more assured from his position
as his country’s sole eminent representative in the
region of polite comedy.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century had thus endowed Italy with
dramatic poets of European reputation, worthy to be
inscribed on the same roll as Racine and Molière. All
the varied dramatic activity of the Cinque Cento, Machiavelli’s
<em>Mandragola</em> and the two great pastoral dramas excepted,
belonging essentially to a lower sphere, fails to
counterweigh the masterpieces of Alfieri and Goldoni.
Even their achievement, nevertheless, did not amount
to the creation of a national drama. If tragedy and
comedy can be said to have taken root at all, the latter
degenerated, while the former put forth only sparse
and occasional flowers. Alfieri’s best plays continue
stock-pieces to this extent, that they are revived as
offering the most suitable opportunities for the display
of the brilliant histrionic genius which from time to time
irradiates the Italian stage. A succession of gifted men&mdash;Monti,
Foscolo, Manzoni, Pellico, Niccolini, Cossa&mdash;have
continued the tradition, and on the whole the state
of tragedy seems much the same in Italy as in England.
Comedy, on the other hand, notwithstanding some encouraging
signs of revival, is far from vigorous, and the
melodrama which occupies the stage is devoid of literary
pretensions. Under these discouraging circumstances it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span>
is not perhaps very extraordinary, though assuredly it is
very amusing, that the Italian <em>literati</em> of the present day,
as reported by their interviewer-general, Signor Ojetti,
should gravely pronounce the drama which they cannot
write a rudimentary and superannuated form of art in
comparison with the novel which they can&mdash;<em>ein ueberwundener
Standpunkt</em>, as would be said in Germany.
The idea of modern romancers transcending the art
of Shakespeare and Sophocles is delightful from its
modesty; but it must be evident that the short story
alone can rival the artistic finish of a perfect drama,
for every romance on a large scale must necessarily
be eked out by descriptions, reflections, and episodes
unessential to the main action.</p>

<p>The cause of the failure of the drama to establish itself
in the land of opera is certainly not to be found in any
preference on the part of the public for the tedious
psychological analysis of the modern school of fiction
over the rapidity and variety of the stage, but rather in
some deep-seated trait of the national character. This
is most probably the prevailing sensuousness of the
people&mdash;a term not here used in any disparaging sense,
but as expressing the national preference for the eye to
the ear. <em>Segnius irritant</em>, as an ancient Italian has it.
The shows of the <em>Rappresentazioni</em> were undoubtedly
more attractive to the Florentine public than the verses
which expounded them; and we have seen that magnificent
scenic equipments were needed to bring the people
to share the dramatic amusements of the courts of the
sixteenth century. This tendency would probably be
found to be inveterate, and to date from the period
when the Atellan farces of Latium prefigured the <em>Commedia
dell’ Arte</em>. It was not mere love of bloodshed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>
made gladiatorial shows popular at Rome. Professor
Mahaffy remarks that while the refinement of Terence’s
translations from the Greek in comparison with Plautus
attests the improvement of the taste of the Roman aristocracy,
“this brilliant success was not popular with the
masses, and led to no further attempts in the same
direction.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>THE REVIVAL</small></h2>


<p>We have seen that the Italy of the eighteenth century
had fully entered into the general intellectual movement
of the rest of Europe. Scarcely any trace remained of
the special characteristics of the Cinque Cento except the
imperishable tradition of culture and refinement which
still kept literature at a high level of style. The vagaries
of the seventeenth century had passed without leaving a
trace. The prevailing taste was that of France. The
chief exception to this polished uniformity was found in
the drama. On the lyrical stage, Italy, favoured by the
musical capabilities of her language and the superior
aptitudes of her vocalists, had created something really
novel and national; and in the allied realm of instrumental
music had emulated the architectural and pictorial
triumphs of the sixteenth century. In tragedy and comedy,
moreover, she had at length attained to a semblance of a
national drama; but this, being the achievement of two
exceptionally gifted men, who in comedy at all events
left no worthy successors, was comparatively apart from
the national life, and could not be expected to prove an
important element in the literary development of the
future.</p>

<p>What Italy was at that time as regards originality, she
has continued to be until our own day. While claiming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span>
her full share in the conquests of science, and by no
means behind-hand in the study of antiquity, she has
produced little that can be regarded as an absolute
creation. Leopardi, alike in genius and art the most
consummate among her men of letters, has wrought on
old lines, exalting the forms he found to more eminent
perfection. Manzoni’s innovations are chiefly introduced
from beyond the Alps. Carducci has rendered a priceless
service in repressing the language’s tendency to
fluent inanity, and has widely expanded its metrical capabilities,
but has mainly worked upon hints derived from
antique or foreign literatures. If, however, Italy has
originated none of the great movements which have
transformed European literature since the middle of the
eighteenth century, she has participated in them all. As
she then fully associated herself with the enlightened and
humanising tendencies of that beneficent if prosaic age;
she has since entered freely into the four great movements
which have broken up eighteenth-century formality
and bought life and liberty at the price of intellectual
disorder&mdash;the naturalistic, the sentimental, the romantic,
and the revolutionary.</p>

<p>The naturalistic impulse to the living and accurate
description of natural beauty, and the recognition of a
living spirit in Nature, is no modern phenomenon. It is
present as a vivifying influence in the classics and in the
poetry of Palestine and the East, and even more so in
Celtic literature, where more than anywhere else it appears
spontaneous and exempt from literary manipulation.
Whether from a Celtic admixture of race or from
some other reason, it seems among modern literatures
the more especial property of the British. The descriptions
of Shakespeare and Milton, like those of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
Greek predecessors, may have been surpassed in the
minute elaboration of detail, not in truth or feeling.
Spenser affords a still better example, for&mdash;the multitudinous
melodies of his peculiar stanza excepted&mdash;this is
the one point in which he transcends his Italian models.
In propriety of plan, in human and dramatic interest, in
terseness and polish of style, he is greatly their inferior;
but the natural descriptions of Ariosto and Tasso, beautiful
as they often are, fall far behind his in rich warmth
and glowing splendour.</p>

<p>This national gift fell into abeyance in the later half
of the seventeenth century: there is scarcely a vestige of it
in Dryden except where he reproduces Chaucer. Thomson’s
<em>Seasons</em> mark its revival, and were not without their
effect in Europe; yet it must be owned that its modern
herald and hierophant is not a Briton, but a Swiss justly
reckoned among French authors&mdash;Jean Jacques Rousseau.
It was the mission of this extraordinary man to inaugurate
not merely the naturalistic, but the sentimental
movement also, which, taken up by Sterne and Goethe,
filled Europe with imitators, and, among other consequences,
gave a great impulse to the novel at the
expense of the drama. Neither the description of nature
nor the analysis of feeling is peculiarly congenial to the
Italian character, and it may be doubted whether the
latter impulse would have been very deeply felt but for
the unhappy political circumstances of the country,
which engendered among the noblest minds a prevailing
disgust and despair conducive to the diffusion of morbid
sentiment and a generally mournful cast of thought.
Both the naturalistic and the sentimental tendencies inaugurated
by Rousseau found a powerful representative
in Ugo Foscolo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>The next great development of taste by which Italian
literature came to be modified was one with which the
Italian temperament has naturally so little sympathy, that
the influence which it exercised and continues to exercise
must be regarded as a strong proof of the susceptibility
of Italy to all great currents affecting intellectual Europe.
The romantic school is at variance with all her literary
traditions and all her canons of taste. Had it been
anything but an exotic, it would have come into being
centuries before among a people rich in popular legends,
and whose history abounds with subjects adapted for
ballad poetry. Little, however, is seen or heard of it
until, as the cosmopolitan drift becomes more and more
powerful, Shakespeare, Goethe, and Scott excite the curiosity
of the Italian reading public. One reason for this
backwardness may be plausibly alleged in the absence of
Gothic architecture from Italy. The earliest architectural
remains were either classical or Byzantine, which passed
so easily into the Palladian and other modern Italian
styles as to render Gothic architecture in Italy little more
than an episode, and to leave no room for those impressions
of vague sublimity and solemn grandeur which
Gothic architecture produces, and which so naturally
spring up in the minds of the inhabitants of countries
covered like England and Germany with ruined castles
and abbeys. Every feeling which the artist of the
romantic school would address is aroused by the mossed
keeps and mouldering fanes of mediæval antiquity.
Horace Walpole may have been a dilettante in architecture
as in literature; nevertheless the romantic school
in England is inaugurated by Strawberry Hill and the
<em>Castle of Otranto</em>; and Goethe’s residence at Strasburg
had much to do with <em>Goetz von Berlichingen</em>. When, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span>
the other hand, the Northern man is initiated into the
beauties of Italian architecture, his romantic feeling is
apt to wane, as he himself admits:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>’Tis not for centuries four for nought<br />

And all things absolutely made.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">The feeling thus expressed by Clough, speaking through
the mouth of the Devil, is utterly contrary to the mystic
awe and vague apprehension of infinity characteristic of
romantic art. It is no wonder, therefore, that the movement
engendered towards the middle of the eighteenth
century by impatience with the prosaic present and
reaction towards the neglected Middle Age, favoured by
the moral atmosphere created by Rousseau, and for
England and Germany so imperious a necessity that
Wordsworth, Scott, Coleridge, Novalis and Tieck, all
romanticists from the cradle, appeared in the world
within three years, should have been little heard of in
Italy until Scott and Goethe had captivated the youthful
genius of Manzoni. Yet a streak of romantic light had
preceded, though from quite a different quarter, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[Pg 332]</span>
Ossian. If the Gaelic bard’s antiquity was questionable,
he was not the less acceptable to a modern imagination;
and the prodigious success in all European nations of
what would have been universally derided thirty years
sooner, showed that new tastes and new cravings had been
awakened among them. Of these Italy had her share, as
attested, towards the end of the eighteenth century, by
the vogue of the translation of Ossian by Cesarotti.</p>

<p>Not much need be said in this place of the last great
factor in the literary metamorphosis to which Italy, in
common with the rest of Europe, had to conform herself.
The Revolution modified literature by altering the environment
of men of letters, supplying them with themes
and ideas which could not otherwise have come within
their scope, and inspiring them with vehement passions
according as their circumstances and temperaments led
them to champion the new gospel or rally to the ancient
traditions. Italy was one of the last countries to feel its
effects in the literary sphere, chiefly because the movement
did not, as elsewhere, originate in the land itself,
but was thrust upon it by an invader whose rapine
alienated much of the patriotic sentiment that would
otherwise have welcomed the Revolution. Monti, the
first great Italian writer whose career was powerfully
affected by it, was neither a revolutionist nor an anti-revolutionist,
but a straw in a whirlpool. When, however,
the idea of Italian unity&mdash;Napoleon’s legacy to his
true native country&mdash;had had time to develop itself, and
it had become manifest that the only path to it lay
through a cordial adoption of revolutionary principles,
the Revolution acquired more practical significance for
Italy than for any other country in Europe.</p>

<p>In a certain respect, Alfieri may be considered as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
first representative of both the sentimental and the
national tendencies in modern Italian literature. He
had denounced tyranny and extolled liberty while the
Bastille had yet many years to stand; and if he could
not write like Goethe or Rousseau, he had practically
lived, and recorded in his autobiography, a life of
sentimental passion. The air of the Revolution, nevertheless,
was needed to bring these germs to maturity.
Its stimulating influence is especially conspicuous in the
tone of Madame de Staël’s <em>Corinne</em>, compared with that
of the letters of Goethe and Beckford. The landscape
is the same, but is beheld in quite another light. Thus
encouraged by general European sympathy, the revolutionary
and sentimental movements overpower the
pliable Monti, and find a genuine representative in the
moody and malcontent Foscolo. The romantic movement,
which Italy would hardly have originated for
herself, necessarily came later, and found its leader in
Manzoni. Silvio Pellico and others acceded, and connected
these currents of feeling with the more decided
revolutionary impulse of a later generation, typified in
Leopardi, Giusti, and Mazzini.</p>

<p>V<small>INCENZO</small> M<small>ONTI</small> (1754-1828) is indeed no representative
of the Revolution, for the most celebrated of
his poems is a denunciation of it, and although he afterwards
changed sides, the Republic was for him merely a
transition to the Empire. He nevertheless in a measure
personifies Italy herself amid the gusts of the revolutionary
tempest, tossed to and fro between contending
influences, her sails spread to the sky, her anchor still
cleaving to earth. Born in the district of Ferrara, and
having gone through the ordeal, so often exacted from
poets, of distasteful law-study, he repaired to Rome as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span>
a literary adventurer, and by his splendid tercets on the
Beauty of Nature and other lyrics adapted for recitation,
sang himself into the good graces of the Papal court.
He took a yet higher flight in his fine, rather lyrical
than dramatic, tragedy of <em>Aristodemo</em> (1787), as superior
to Alfieri in versification as inferior in virile energy. The
subject is one of the most pathetic, the grief of a father
for having slain his daughter. The <em>Galeotto Manfredi</em>
(1788), partly inspired by private circumstances, is interesting
as one of the first Italian examples of romantic
tragedy. One of the characters is copied from Iago.</p>

<p>It was not until 1793 that Monti took rank as the
first epic poet of his time by his <em>Bassvilliana</em>, a poem
on the murder of the French diplomatist Bassville,
who had perished in a tumult provoked by his own
imprudence. Never since the tentmaker of Tarsus was
caught up into the third heaven was an obscure person
elevated so mightily as this insignificant Bassville, of
whose remorseful spirit Monti’s ardent imagination
makes a new Dante, guided by an angel to behold
the atrocities of the French Revolution as a penance
preliminary to its entrance into Paradise. In the whole
compass of literature there is perhaps no other instance
of so close and successful a copy as Monti’s of Dante,
combined with so much impetuous vigour, and other
qualities not usually associated with imitation. It revealed
Monti as the most impressionable of poets in his
equal subjugation by Dantesque influences and by the
passions of the hour. Such a man must needs move
with the times. Ere long the Papal courtier was the
friend and guest of the French generals, inditing
thundering odes against superstition and fanaticism;
soon he held office under the Cisalpine Republic, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
when the Austrians prevailed he fled to Paris. He came
back as the courtier and flatterer of Napoleon; and yet
this versatility seems less the effect of self-interest than
of ductility of character, and his countrymen laughingly
talked of the three periods of the <em>abate</em>, the <em>citizen</em>,
and the <em>cavalier</em> Monti. This sensitiveness was serviceable
to his lyric genius, for he thrilled with the emotion
he wished to express, and in expressing it approved
himself a perfect master of language and metre.</p>

<p>In the interval between Monti’s withdrawal from
Rome and the brilliant position which under the Imperial
auspices he acquired at Milan, he had produced
his <em>Prometheus</em>, one of the finest examples of Italian
blank verse, but a curious mixture of things ancient
and modern; his <em>Musologia</em>, charming octaves on the
Muses; <em>Caius Gracchus</em>, a tragedy betraying imitation
of Shakespeare’s <em>Coriolanus</em>, celebrated for the force
of the fifth act; <em>Mascheroniana</em>, a palinode for the
<em>Bassvilliana</em>, notwithstanding the art with which the
poet manages to assert his consistency. Disfigured as
it is by adulation of Napoleon and senseless abuse of
England<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, this is perhaps Monti’s finest poem. It is the
offspring of a genuine poetic <em>œstrum</em>, which whirls the
stuff of a party pamphlet into sublimity, like a rag in a
hurricane. It was never finished. Incomplete too is
the <em>Bard of the Black Forest</em>, a poem on Napoleon’s exploits,
unequal to the subject, but remarkable for its
concise rapidity of expression. Monti was now Napoleon’s
official laureate for the Italian department, and it
is sufficiently amusing to find him expressing his apprehensions
lest he should be so far carried away by his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>patriotism as to offend the reigning powers, and breathing
a superfluous prayer for prudence in his vocation.
There was little danger; patriotism, though a genuine,
was a weaker emotion with him than respect for dignities,
as he sufficiently evinced by his obedience to the
Austrian mandate to celebrate the expulsion of the
French, although he never abased himself so far as to
assail Napoleon. He lost his office of historiographer,
and retiring into private life, devoted himself mainly to
critical and philological work. He had a short time
previously published a translation of the <em>Iliad</em>, commenced
in 1790, highly admired by his countrymen, and
certainly a remarkable performance when it is considered
that he scarcely knew a word of Greek; whence Foscolo
wittily called him <em>gran traduttor dei traduttor d’Omero</em>.
So much more important to the translator is flexibility of
mind than exactness of scholarship. Monti’s later days,
now embittered by controversies and pecuniary embarrassments,
mitigated by the generosity of friends, now
brightened by successful work on his unfinished <em>Feronia</em>,
a youthful production in which he had celebrated the
draining of the Pontine marshes, or by the production
of some fine lyric, passed on the whole tranquilly until
his death in 1828 from the effects of a paralytic stroke.</p>


<p>The eloquent but unspeculative Monti had nothing to
teach but his almost inimitable art of verbal expression,
and hence has founded no school. His reputation has declined,
chiefly from the ephemeral character of the themes
on which his genius was expended, and of which none but
himself could have made so much. He can hardly be
called a great poet, if for no other reason than that his
impressionable imagination wanted tenacity; he tired of
his own works, and left the majority of them incomplete.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span>
He is nevertheless a brilliant phenomenon, the more
interesting from the decidedly national stamp of his
genius. He has Southern demonstrativeness and volubility,
and kindles like a meteor by his own flight; when
thoroughly fired, whether in epic or lyric, he is almost
an improvisatore. Improvisation in an English poet
would seem a <em>tour de force</em> at best, but it appears natural
to the quick intelligence and musical speech of Italy.</p>

<p>Monti is thus a representative of his nation, and is no
less true to the general spirit of his epoch: classic in
aspiration, modern in sentiment, related to the Greeks
much as Canova was related to Phidias. He was no
interpreter of his age, but a faithful mirror of its successive
phases, and endowed with the rare gift of sublimity
to a degree scarcely equalled by any contemporary except
Goethe, Byron, and Shelley. The descriptions in the
<em>Mascheroncide</em> of Napoleon’s descent upon Italy, and of
the inundation of the Po, if not perfect models of taste,
are almost Lucretian in their stormy and tumultuous
grandeur. The frequent poverty, or at least shallowness
of his thought is veiled by splendid diction; and in tact
and felicity of encomium he recalls Dryden, whom he
so strongly resembles in the character of many of his
compositions, the versatility of his conduct, and the circumstances
of his life. A further analogy may be found
in the eminence of both as critics, Monti’s disquisitions
on Dante and the Cruscan vocabulary constituting as
important a portion of his work as Dryden’s prefaces of
his. His dialogues, chiefly between deceased authors
and grammarians recalled from the shades to discuss
philological questions, are charming for their elegance
and grace.</p>

<p>U<small>GO</small> F<small>OSCOLO</small> (1778-1827), the second eminent poet of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span>
the revolutionary period, successively Monti’s champion
and his adversary, is in most respects a violent contrast
to him. It would have been well had he been merely
his complement. Monti’s pliant character greatly needed
an infusion of vigour and independence; but Foscolo,
though a self-restrained artist in his poems, in his life
required the curb as much as Monti required the spur.
Worse, his tempestuous vehemence and crabbed indocility
were no tokens of real strength; he was at
bottom weak and whimsical, the slave of passion, physical
and intellectual. His countrymen, nevertheless, have
forgotten his faults and follies for the sake of his untarnished
patriotism, most unjustly suspected in his own
day; he is the first very distinguished modern Italian
whose consistency in this particular is a source of national
joy and pride. Alfieri’s resentment against the French,
though sufficiently excusable, blinded him to the real
tendency of his times; other well-meaning men were
either too intimately associated with the temporary
makeshift of the despotic Empire, or too amenable to
clerical pressure. Foscolo was untainted by either influence,
and might be deemed not only absolved but
canonised by his countrymen when Garibaldi made a
pilgrimage to his tomb at Chiswick, and when, in 1871,
his remains were transferred to the cemetery at Florence,
the inspiration of the most famous of his poems.</p>

<p>Alike in personal character and the quality of his productions,
Foscolo may be compared with Landor, but
with the capital distinction that Landor was a man of the
past, and Foscolo, for all his Greek erudition and classical
enthusiasm, a man of his own time. His romance,
<em>Jacopo Ortis</em> (1798), perhaps the most celebrated of his
productions, is a reminiscence of <em>Werther</em> and a fore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>runner
of <em>René</em>, but adds to the merely personal sorrows
of these tragic autobiographies the nobler motive of
despair at the ruin and enslavement of the hero’s country.
Foscolo, though born at Zante, was prouder of his
Venetian descent than of his Greek nativity, and the
ignominious end of so glorious a history as the Republic’s
not unnaturally or ignobly drove him to despair. At
the same time he was usually under the spell of some
woman; one of his genuine letters, indeed, written at a
much later date, surpasses his romance in the eloquence
of unhappy passion. Both motives combine to drive
Ortis to suicide. Apart from its impressive style, the
book is weak and unwholesome, but it powerfully depicts
an unquestionable tendency of the age, and as such has a
right to live, apart from its influence on Leopardi, George
Sand, and other more recent writers of genius. Foscolo’s
melancholy, fretful and egotistic as it is, is not pessimism;
it is not grounded in the nature of things, but is always
remediable by a change in external circumstances.</p>

<p>Unlike the exuberant Monti, Foscolo wrote little
poetry, but his scanty production is of choice quality.
His most celebrated poem is the <em>Sepolcri</em> (1807), which
in style and subject bears a remarkable resemblance
to the finest poem America has yet given to the world,
Bryant’s <em>Thanatopsis</em>. The American poet has conceived
his work in a larger and grander spirit, and consequently
surpasses Foscolo in the sublimity of his thought, though
the latter’s poem is longer and adorned with episodes,
and in merit of execution there may be little to choose.
Bryant dwells on the majesty of death; Foscolo on the
reverence due to the tomb, and the immortality of the
memories of the great&mdash;a fine theme undoubtedly, and
deserving of the monumental eloquence with which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span>
has adorned it, but small if measured against Bryant’s.
Foscolo’s other most considerable poetical composition,
his <em>Hymns to the Graces</em>, celebrated as the beneficent
spirits of Greece, Italy, and an ideal world, was long but
an aggregation of fragments, and was recovered as a
whole only in 1856. The fastidious author could never
satisfy himself, and the result is a production more remarkable
for high polish than warmth of poetic feeling.
It is just such a poem as Landor might have written.
Foscolo’s tragedies, <em>Ajax</em> and <em>Ricciarda</em>, are fine compositions
in the spirit of Alfieri: the former, notwithstanding
its classical theme, has a relation to contemporary
circumstances, Moreau being depicted as Ajax, and
Bonaparte as Agamemnon. The few minor poems of
Foscolo are admirable, full of weighty lines that imprint
themselves on the memory. As a critic he accomplished
more than it will be easy to accomplish after him, coming
just at the moment when Europe, weary of the superficial
æsthetics of the eighteenth century, was anxiously looking
for a guide to the spirit of the past. It is as much
by this happy fortune as by their intrinsic merit that his
essays mark an era in the literary history of Dante,
Petrarch, Tasso, and Boccaccio.</p>

<p>Foscolo’s agitated life has afforded matter for many biographers,
but the essential facts lie in narrow compass.
Born in Zante of mixed Venetian and Greek parentage,
he early sought Venice, and learned the secret of literary
style from Cesarotti, the translator of Ossian. The shameful
extinction of the Venetian Republic by France and
Austria combined with his own ill-regulated passions to
make him write <em>Jacopo Ortis</em> and talk of imitating his
suicidal hero. A spell of military service, partly at the
siege of Genoa, partly in the army destined for the in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span>vasion
of England, went far to cure him, and he spent
several years as a man of letters at Milan, translating
Homer, composing his tragedies, and too much engaged
in unedifying literary quarrels for his own dignity or the
credit of letters. He showed an honourable independence
in rejecting the bribes offered to induce him to
adulate Napoleon, and, equally spurning the proffered
subvention of the Austrian Government, became an exile
at the overthrow of the Empire. He ultimately took
refuge in England, exchanged, he might have boasted,
for Byron. Here he was warmly received in aristocratic
as well as literary circles, and might have performed a
distinguished part. But his extravagance and his irregular
habits wore out his friends’ patience, though Mr.
Smiles says: “Ugo Foscolo lived to the end of his life
surrounded by all that was luxurious and beautiful.”
If so, Hudson Gurney, who raised his tomb, must have
given him bread as well as a stone. He was also
affectionately tended by his natural daughter, whose
mother was an Englishwoman. He died in September
1827. Some of his best critical work belongs to this
last period, and a valuable correspondence from English
friends is understood to be awaiting publication. His
own letters are admirable, full of life and movement.</p>

<p>Little as I<small>PPOLITO</small> P<small>INDEMONTE</small> (1754-1825) resembled
Foscolo either as an author or as a man, their names are
frequently associated on account of Pindemonte’s reply
to Foscolo’s <em>Sepolcri</em>, a fine poem breathing the spirit of
resignation and tranquillity, for which his gloomy predecessor
had left him abundant scope. Pindemonte’s best
production, however, is his <em>Antonio Foscarini</em>, a true tale
of unhappy love, recited with great pathos in elegant
octaves. He is a kind of Italian Cowper, a gentle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span>
amiable valetudinarian. Like Cowper, he sang country
life, and touched the events and the manners of his times
in a strain of soft elegiac melancholy; like Cowper, too,
he translated Homer. He holds no such important
position in Italian as Cowper does in English literature,
but represents the large class of his fellow-citizens who,
carrying the spirit of the eighteenth century into the
nineteenth, were rather ornamental than useful to their
country.</p>

<p>Monti and Foscolo, with all their genius, could not
escape the influence of their times. In the French and
Italian literature of the Imperial period, and still more
in its art, a certain pseudo-classical affectation is visible.
Sublimity and grace are attained indeed, but there is
something mannered about the one, and something fastidious
about the other. The reigning taste required to
be brought nearer to Nature, and the writer who could
effect this was sure to mark an epoch in the literature
of his country. The mission was discharged by A<small>LESSANDRO</small>
M<small>ANZONI</small> (1785-1873), a man who announces a
new departure in many ways, and whose historical significance,
even more than his fine genius, places him above
the still more gifted Leopardi at the head of the Italian
literature of the first half of the nineteenth century. From
one point of view he signalises the invasion of the romantic
spirit. Goethe, Byron, Shakespeare, Scott are more
to him than the old Italian masters. From another,
he founds the Neo-Catholic school, and personifies the
revival of the religious spirit in its most gentle and
edifying form. Monti and Foscolo had been sceptics;
Manzoni is devout, while at the same time there is nothing
grotesque in his mediævalism, and he keeps the
spheres of religion and politics so apart as to be able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
to hail the downfall of the temporal power. Yet, again,
he is a reformer of the language, and the first to form
a style equally acceptable to his cultured and to his
unlettered countrymen.</p>

<p>The hero of these various achievements was singularly
unlike the usual type of great renovators and innovators.
Such epoch-making personages rarely want for self-assertion.
Manzoni was a gentle, undemonstrative man,
though observant of others and not ignorant of his own
worth, and capable of sarcasm on occasion; a valetudinarian,
whose dread of crowds frequently confined him
to his house, who made no display, mounted no rostrum,
and ceased to write at forty. Hence, though <em>I Promessi
Sposi</em> is probably more widely known than any Italian
book after the <em>Divina Commedia</em>, the author has failed to
personally impress the European imagination, and appears
a mere shadow in comparison with Victor Hugo
or even Lamartine, neither of whom, notwithstanding
their infinitely greater productiveness, so profoundly
influenced the literature of their country. Born at
Milan, Manzoni was an Austrian subject, and, though
a true patriot, shunned to offend the ruling powers.
He led the life of a respectable Italian gentleman of
moderate fortune, at one time greatly impaired by his
father’s extravagance, and basked for nearly half a
century in the tranquil enjoyment of European fame,
which, after the success of <em>I Promessi Sposi</em>, he imperilled
by no further venture. “Formerly,” he said
in excuse, “the Muse came after me, now I should
have to go after her.” The events of 1848 failed to
draw him from his retirement; when the unity of
Italy was accomplished he accepted public honours,
but declined public duties; none criticised his inaction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
for all felt that he had done his best by Italy. His
death at the age of eighty-eight evoked such a unanimity
of sentiment as has perhaps accompanied that
of no great author of modern times except Sir Walter
Scott. Goethe had hostile detractors. Settembrini and
the few others who presumed to criticise Manzoni urged
their scruples in a spirit of becoming reverence.</p>

<p>Manzoni’s claim to this universal veneration was three-fold.
In the first place, he was really a great writer; in
the second, he was the standard-bearer of Italian literature,
the one contemporary author of his nation who could be
named along with Goethe and Byron; thirdly and chiefly,
he represented the most important intellectual movement
of the post-Napoleonic age, the romantic and mediæval
reaction&mdash;a necessity, for justice demanded it. The
Middle Age was indeed no model for the nineteenth century,
as the romanticists and reactionaries thought, but it
did possess elements indispensable for the enrichment of
the national life; and although the Italian mind was probably
less in harmony with these than the mind of any
other people, no Italian could forget that the greatest
of his countrymen was also the greatest and most representative
writer of the Middle Ages. It had been
one of Monti’s chief merits to have emulated and revived
the style of Dante, to the disgust of Pope Pius VI.,
who asked him why on earth he could not write like
Metastasio. After the form came the spirit of the
<em>Divine Comedy</em>, commended to the nation by the misfortunes
and deceptions which succeeded the fall of
Napoleon, when the exile of Florence appeared more
than ever a symbol of his country. The worshippers
of Dante were indeed divided, some seeing in him the
Ghibelline, the enemy of the temporal power no less than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
of the foreigner; others, the apostle of mediæval Catholicism.
Both views were right and both wrong, and the
choice between them was merely a matter of temperament,
but the latter was the more likely to be propagated
by the air of the time.</p>

<p>The gentle and modest Manzoni obeyed the more
potent influence. In 1812 he began to produce his
hymns, mostly on the festivals of the Church, which
perhaps suggested Keble’s <em>Christian Year</em>. They were
published in 1815, but the finest, that for Whitsunday,
is a later addition. They attracted little attention
until the appearance of his famous ode on the death
of Napoleon, <em>Il Cinque Maggio</em>, which, appearing at
the right “psychological moment,” at a time when
every man felt almost as an intimate of the great conqueror
who had made so large a portion of his own
existence, took Italy and Europe by storm. The note
of personal compassion which pervades it was then in
place, but now that Napoleon’s exploits and disasters are
ancient history, and he is chiefly regarded as a great
world-shaker and incarnate elemental force, we feel the
need of a deeper insight and a wider sweep. Even
Manzoni’s fire and eloquence, vivid as they are, scarcely
rival Lamartine’s on the same subject. A patriotic poem
of equal power, the ode on the march of the Piedmontese
volunteers to succour the Lombards in 1821, imaginary
as fact, but veracious as prophecy, has suffered less,
or indeed nothing, from the lapse of time, expressing
the deepest feelings of every Italian heart now as then.
Though composed in 1821, it was not so much as written
down until 1848, from apprehension of the Austrian
police. No less fine are the lyrics in Manzoni’s tragedies,
the <em>Carmagnola</em> (1820) and the <em>Adelchi</em> (1822).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>These dramas themselves mark an epoch in Italian
literary history, not so much from their absolute merit,
as from being the first attempt to adapt Shakespearian
methods to the Italian drama. Alfieri and Monti had
adhered to the classical school; Manzoni struck into
a new path, and by so doing revealed a new world
to his countrymen, little as it followed that the old
world need be entirely forsaken. The <em>Carmagnola</em>
depicts the condottieri of the fifteenth century, the
<em>Adelchi</em> the Lombards of the eighth. The latter is the
more dramatic, and the two principal characters, Adelchi
and Ermengarda, are depicted with extreme beauty and
power. The pieces, however, are rather dramatic poems
than plays, and rise highest where there is most scope
for poetry. Martin the Deacon’s description of his
journey in the <em>Adelchi</em>, for instance, so finely translated
by Mr. W. D. Howells, is magnificent, but on a scale
disproportioned to the play. The fire and spirit of
the two martial lyrics in the <em>Carmagnola</em> and the
<em>Adelchi</em> respectively are marvellous; “their wonderful
plunging metre,” it has been said, “suggests a charge
of horses.” That in the <em>Adelchi</em> should alone vindicate
Manzoni against the accusation of unpatriotic lukewarmness.
It paints the lot of the Italian people of
the eighth century, transferred by the fortune of war
from a Lombard master to a Frank, who unite to
oppress them, and nothing can be more evident than
the contemporary application to Italian, Austrian, and
Frenchman. The following slightly abridged version is
by Miss Ellen Clerke:</p>

<p class="p1">If Manzoni was surpassed as a dramatist and equalled
as a lyrist by others among his countrymen, he has
hitherto found no competitor as a novelist. <em>I Promessi
Sposi</em> (1825) was the first great Italian romance, and it
remains the greatest. It would be difficult to transcend
its capital merits, the beauty and truth of description,
the interest of its leading characters, and its perfect
fidelity to life, if not in every respect to the place and
period where and when the scene is laid&mdash;Milan under
the dreary Spanish rule of the seventeenth century&mdash;yet
to the universal feelings and instincts of humanity. As
a picture of human nature the book is above criticism;
it is just the fact, neither more nor less. “It satisfies us,”
said Goethe, “like perfectly ripe fruit.” It has, notwithstanding,
a weak side, which Goethe did not fail to
point out&mdash;the prominence of the historical element, and
the dryness with which the writer exhibits his authorities,
instead of dissolving them in the flow of his narrative.
“The German translator,” said Goethe, “must get rid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
of a great part of the war and the famine, and two-thirds
of the plague.” Other objections to Manzoni’s romance
refer to its real or supposed tendencies, which leave its
artistic merits unaffected. It may be granted that panegyrics
upon Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, however just,
were hardly seasonable when the Pope was the fast ally
of the Austrian; and Manzoni did still worse by his
country when (1819) he wrote a treatise on Catholic
Morals, unexceptionable when there should be no more
question of the Temporal Power. But he then cherished
generous illusions which he was ultimately obliged to
renounce; though never parting with one of the leading
and most remarkable features of <em>I Promessi Sposi</em>, its
sympathy with the poor and lowly. It is a remarkable
proof of the difficulties of style which beset the Italian
author, that Manzoni found it necessary to give his
romance a thorough revision to bring its diction nearer
to the Tuscan standard. His other prose works comprise,
the <em>Column of Infamy</em>, an historical appendix to
<em>I Promessi Sposi</em>, <em>Letters on Romanticism</em>, an able polemic
on behalf of the romantic school, and <em>Letters on the
Unities of Time and Place</em>, demonstrating that the unity
of action is the only unity which need be regarded by
the dramatist.</p>

<p>The success of <em>I Promessi Sposi</em> could not but create
a school of historical novelists in Italy, whose works
probably effected more for the propagation of Italian
literature beyond the Alps than those of any writer except
Manzoni himself. The <em>Marco Visconti</em> of Tommaso
Grossi, the <em>Ettorre Fieramosca</em> of Massimo d’Azeglio, the
<em>Margherita Pusterla</em> of Cesare Cantù, are romances of
great merit, but, as the author of one of them exclaims,
“How far we are behind Manzoni!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>Little as any anti-national motive can be attributed to
the <em>Adelchi</em>, it is true that Manzoni’s patriotism was
chiefly evinced in his lyrics, and that he was not prominent
as a patriotic dramatist. This part was reserved
for G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> N<small>ICCOLINI</small> (1782-1861). In times
of trial and distress the measure of service is apt to be
the measure of applause, and popular gratitude may for
a time have exalted Niccolini’s tragedies to a higher level
than that due to their strictly literary desert. They are
nevertheless fine productions, and the most patriotic are
usually the best. <em>Arnaldo di Brescia</em>, too bold an apotheosis
of the fiery monk who defied the Papacy in the
twelfth century to be printed in Italy for many years after
its appearance in France, is the most poetical, but is
neither intended nor adapted for the stage. Notwithstanding
its historical subject, this mighty tragedy, as
Mr. W. D. Howells, the translator of some of its finest
passages, not unjustly terms it, is an idealistic work.
The other dramas, taken from history, and representing
such crises in Italian story as the destruction of Florentine
liberty and the Sicilian Vespers, are more compliant
with ordinary dramatic rules; but the most celebrated
and successful on the stage is <em>Antonio Foscarini</em>, founded
on the same incident in Venetian history that had afforded
the subject of Pindemonte’s poem. Before he became
imbued with the spirit of the romantic school, Niccolini
had acquired great distinction as a classical dramatist,
especially by his <em>Polissena</em> and his <em>Medea</em>. His first performance,
<em>Nabucco</em> (1816), idealised the fall of Napoleon
in a Babylonian tragedy. Among his plays is a free
translation of Shelley’s <em>Cenci</em>, in general excellent, but
remarkable for the entire disfigurement of the opening
speech, no doubt for prudential reasons. At first poor,
afterwards in easy circumstances, Niccolini spent an
uneventful life in the service of the Academy of Florence;
his mode of living was sequestered, and his character
stainless.</p>

<p>With all his good-will, Niccolini could deal no such
blows at foreign or domestic oppressors as that which a
brother dramatist of greatly inferior power delivered by
the mere record of his sufferings. <em>Le Mie Prigioni</em>
made S<small>ILVIO</small> P<small>ELLICO</small> (1789-1854) as typical a figure as
the Iron Mask or the Prisoner of Chillon, and won Italy
a moral victory in her darkest day (1832). It is needless
to give any particular account of so famous a book.
The candid and innocent author was born to move mankind
by a single story, and to relapse into obscurity after
delivering his message. His dramas and lyrics do not
exceed mediocrity, with the exception of <em>Francesca da
Rimini</em> (1818), a tragedy full of tender feeling, admired
by Byron, to whom the version of some scenes in
the <em>Quarterly Review</em> has been attributed. They were,
however, in fact rendered by Milman.</p>

<small>THE REGENERATION</small></h2>


<p>That only one of the distinguished writers reviewed in
the last chapter should have given free expression to
the Italian craving for liberty and national unity, may be
accounted for in the simplest possible manner. Foscolo
was the only one in exile; the unexpatriated, writing
under a censorship, said not what they would, but what
they could. Apart, nevertheless, from this consideration,
it is true that the national movement was slow in acquiring
energy and consistency, inasmuch as it was not in
the first instance an indigenous growth. The conception
of an Italian nation under a single political head had not
been too clearly formulated, even by Petrarch and Machiavelli,
and since the latter’s time had been in great measure
the exclusive possession of the finest minds. As an
upbursting bubble may hint at what is passing in the
depths of the sea, so Gernando’s scoff in the <em>Gerusalemme
Liberata</em> at Rinaldo as a native of <em>la serva Italia</em> reveals
the hidden workings of Tasso’s spirit, and vindicates him
from the charge of ludicrously servile adulation. Nothing
more ridiculous can be conceived than the poet’s notion
that his patron Alphonso might well lead either the armies
or the fleets of Europe in a new crusade if he was to be
no more than a Duke of Ferrara; not so if the headship
of a united and regenerated Italy was to fall to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>The next generation reposed hopes premature, indeed&mdash;yet,
as the far-off event was to show, not irrational&mdash;in the
house of Savoy; but as time wore on and material circumstances
improved, these patriotic aspirations waned,
and the call for liberty which came from France in the
revolutionary era had to create the sentiment to which
it appealed. Any prospect of such a response seemed
destroyed by the behaviour of the French propaganda
itself&mdash;its infamous betrayal of the Venetian Republic,
its exactions from private fortunes, pillages from public
treasuries, and wholesale robbery of Italian works of art.
Yet by an extraordinary turn of events the chief perpetrator
of these iniquities, himself an Italian, became most
undesignedly on his own part the father of Italian unity
and freedom. By crowning himself King of Italy,
Napoleon Bonaparte gave her a national existence.
After a few years of his rule the inhabitants of the
peninsula could not but perceive that the visions of
their seers and the aspirations of their statesmen had
in great measure come to pass.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the existence of some nominally independent
principalities, for the first time since Theodoric
the Italians of the North at all events actually were
Italians&mdash;not Lombards, or Tuscans, or Piedmontese.
They were indeed ruled by a despot; but to this, with
the practical instinct of their race, the Italians submitted
in the prevision that Napoleon’s empire must be dissolved
by his death, and the hope that the national unity would
survive it and him. Such might well have been the case
had his authority been peacefully transmitted to a successor;
but the circumstances of his downfall inevitably
brought back the Austrians and the exiled princes, to
reign no longer over a contented or an indifferent people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span>
but over one which had taken the idea of national unity
to its heart. The effect on literature is illustrated by a
passage in one of Byron’s letters from Italy: “They talk
Dante, write Dante, and think and dream Dante to an
extent that would be ridiculous but that he deserves it.”
It was not so much the recognition of Dante’s literary
desert which occasioned this reaction from eighteenth-century
neglect, as the incarnation of the sufferings and
the genius of his country in his person.</p>

<p>A generation thus nurtured on Dante, and on Dante
studied from such a point of view, could not but grow up
serious and patriotic. Nor were other literary influences
wanting. The fourth canto of <em>Childe Harold</em>, and even
more Madame de Staël’s <em>Corinne</em>, contrasted in the most
forcible manner the past artistic and intellectual glories
with the actual political degradation, and showed Italy
how far she had fallen, but also how high she might
hope to reascend. Such influences imbued the youthful
generation with a more impassioned and enthusiastic character
than its fathers. The new aspirations embodied
themselves most distinctly in three men&mdash;Mazzini, type
of physical resistance to oppression; Giusti, of relentless
opposition in the intellectual sphere; Leopardi, of the
passive protest of martyrdom. In him, as by an emblem,
the beauty and the anguish of the suffering country are
shown forth, and on this account no less than from the
superiority of his literary genius, though no active insurgent
against the established order of things, he claims
the first place in his hapless but glorious generation.</p>

<p>The tragical yet uneventful life of G<small>IACOMO</small> L<small>EOPARDI</small>
was little else than ardent cultivation of the spirit
and constant struggle with the infirmities of the body.
Born in 1798 at Recanati, a small dull town near Rimini,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[Pg 355]</span>
the son of a learned and high-minded, but unfortunately
bigoted and retrograde Italian nobleman, of anti-national
politics and antiquarian tastes, whose embarrassed circumstances
and incapacity for business had induced him
to assign his property to a practical but parsimonious
wife, Leopardi solaced the forlornness of existence in a
spiritual desert by intense study, favoured by his father’s
extensive library, in which he immured himself to a degree
propitious to neither bodily nor mental health. So
extraordinary were his powers that at nineteen, besides
many excellent <em>bonâ fide</em> translations, he produced imaginary
versions of lost Greek authors which deceived
accomplished classical scholars. But the maladies from
which he was to suffer all his life had already made
progress; he could follow no profession, and was entirely
dependent upon well-intentioned but uncongenial
parents, whose dread of the liberal and free-thinking
opinions he had imbibed, chiefly from correspondence
with Pietro Giordani, induced them to imprison him at
home.</p>

<p>Though solaced by the affection of his brother Carlo
and his sister Paolina, Leopardi’s position was most uncomfortable,
and the chief external events of his history
for many years are his temporary escapes and his enforced
returns. He sought refuge successively at Rome,
Bologna, and Florence, meeting with friends everywhere,
especially at Rome, where he won the esteem and excited
the wonder of Niebuhr and Bunsen. His craving for
deeper sympathy twice involved him in love affairs, both
fruitful in humiliation and disappointment. Nothing
else, indeed, could be expected for the suit of the pallid,
deformed youth, whose blood barely circulated, whose
indigestion almost deprived him of nourishment, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
feeble limbs bent beneath the weight of a body even
so attenuated, and whose heart and lungs scarcely
discharged their office. All active life seemed concentrated
in his brain, which throve and energised at the
expense of every other organ. He executed some work
for the booksellers, especially his condensed but invaluable
comment on Petrarch, and from time to time gave
expression to some slowly-maturing thought, in literary
form meet for immortality, but unvalued and unrecompensed
by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Neither Leopardi’s patriotic sentiments nor his speculative
opinions could be disclosed under the pressure of
Austrian and Bourbon despotism; the King of Sardinia
had not yet declared himself on the side of liberty, and
there was literally no spot in Italy where an Italian could
write what he thought. Emigration to France or England
would have been forbidden by his parents, upon whom
he was entirely dependent. At length, in September 1833,
he was able to establish himself at Naples, where for a
time his health and spirits seemed marvellously improved;
but from the summer of 1836 these retrograded, and he
succumbed to a sudden aggravation of the dropsy which
had long threatened him, on June 14, 1837. His unpublished
philological writings were bequeathed to a Swiss
friend, Professor de Sinner, who neglected his trust.
The MSS., however, were bought from his heirs by the
Italian Government, and have been partially published.
Leopardi’s other works were faithfully edited by Antonio
Ranieri, a friend whose devoted kindness to him during
his life renders it utterly incomprehensible how he should
have sought to blacken his memory after his death by
the publication of a number of painful and humiliating
circumstances, which, if they had been facts, should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span>
been consigned to oblivion, but which Dr. Franco Ridella
has shown to be mere invention.</p>

<p>While he still posed as Leopardi’s Pythias, Ranieri
summed up his friend’s titles to renown as, “first a great
philologer, next a great poet, at the last a great philosopher.”
Great poet he unquestionably was; his refined
classical scholarship might have earned him the distinction
of a great philologer in a sense disused since
comparative philology has taken rank among the exact
sciences; if he was a great philosopher, so Voltaire and
Lucian must be esteemed. The keen sensibility to pain
which dominated his mental constitution was as little
associated with any constructive faculty or capacity for
systematic thought as was their hatred of pretence and
perception of the ludicrous; but while their endowments
were brilliantly serviceable to mankind, Leopardi’s
moral pathology, if it had any potency at all, could
operate only for ill. Mischievous attempts have indeed
been made to accredit the pessimism of our times by
exalting the cries wrung by anguish from a wretched
invalid into the last and ripest fruit of the tree of knowledge.
Whatever may be the case in Oriental countries,
there has seldom been a pessimist in the West without
some moral or physical malady which ought to have
withheld him from assuming the part of an instructor of
mankind; but Leopardi’s pessimism is not only morbid,
but unmanly. The stress which he lays upon merely
physical evils, such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst,
would have moved the contempt of an ancient sage of
any sect; and the contemporary of so many martyrs
for their country admits no spring of human action but
naked egotism. The grandeur and beauty of material
nature, the sublime creations of man’s spirit, the teeming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
harvest of human virtues and affections, the tranquillising
recognition of eternal order and controlling law, the marvellous
course of the world’s history, when not ignored,
are treated as the mere mockery and aggravation of the
entirely imaginary background of blackness&mdash;a shining
leprosy upon a hideous countenance. And yet the real
nature of the man was quite different; his pessimism
and egotism are simply the product of bodily suffering,
of the wounded self-esteem and disappointed affections
which followed in its train, and of the absence of any
outlet for his surpassing intellectual powers.</p>

<p>It was a cruel injury to Italy that her greatest modern
genius should have done so little for her regeneration,
and that his writings, instead of inspiring a healthy public
spirit, should rather tend to foster the selfish indifference
and the despair of good which continue to be her principal
bane. In two points of view, nevertheless, Leopardi
rendered his country essential service. His sufferings,
and the moral infirmities which they entailed, enabled
him to represent in his own person, as no soundly-constituted
man could have done, the unhappy Italy
of his day. He seemed the living symbol of a country
naturally favoured beyond all others, but racked and dismembered
by foreign and domestic tyrants, the counterparts
in the body politic of the maladies which crippled
Leopardi’s energies, and distorted his views of man and
nature. At the same time the transcendent excellence
of his scanty literary performances raised Italian literature
to a height which, Alfieri and Monti notwithstanding,
it had not attained since Tasso, and in the
midst of an epoch of servitude and subjugation gave
Italians at least one thing of which they might justly be
proud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span></p>

<p>The bulk of Leopardi’s writings, indeed, is diminutive,
and the range of his ideas narrow; but within these limits
he has approached absolute perfection more closely, not
only than any other Italian, but than any modern writer.
He is one of that small and remarkable class of men who
have arisen here and there in recent Europe to reproduce
each some peculiar aspect of the ancient Greek
genius. As Shelley is a Greek by his pantheism, Keats by
his feeling for nature, Platen by the architectonic of his
verse, so is Leopardi by his impeccability. All the best
Greek productions, whether of poetic or of plastic art,
have this character of inevitableness: they can neither
be better nor other than they are. It is not the same in
romantic poetry. Shakespeare no doubt always chose
the best path, but he always seems to have had the
choice among a thousand. In almost everything of
Leopardi’s, whether verse or prose, form and thought
appear indissolubly interfused without the possibility
of disjunction. This is eminently the case with his
poems, perfect examples of lofty and sustained eloquence
entirely uncontaminated by rhetoric. There are
few thoughts which strike by their novelty, few elaborated
similes, few phrases which stand forth in isolation
from the environing text. All seems of a piece; but the
words chosen are invariably the most apt to express the
idea sought to be conveyed, and the stream of sentiment
is as pellucid as it is impetuous. The same mastery is
evinced in the descriptive passages, which never appear
to exist for their own sakes, but as depicting the inner
feeling of the poem by a visible symbol. Be the subject
small or great, from the disappearance of a vast landscape
at the setting of the moon, or the terrified peasant
listening sleeplessly to the roar of Vesuvius, down to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>
rain pattering at the poet’s window, or the rattle of the
carriage resuming its journey after the storm, these
descriptions impress by their perfect adequacy and their
complete fusion of speech and thought, and it can only
be objected to them that they are finer than the moralities
they usher in. So wrote the Greeks, and the
recovery of an apparently lost type makes amends for
the monotony of Leopardi’s dismal message to mankind
and the extreme limitation of his range of thought. In
his later days his horizon seemed to expand; his serio-comic
<em>Paralipomeni</em>, already noticed with other examples
of its class, displays an unexpected versatility, and his
last ode, <em>La Ginestra</em>, inspired by the hardy and humble
broom-plant flourishing on the brink of the lava-fields of
Vesuvius, is more original in conception and ampler in
sweep than any of its predecessors. It somewhat resembles
Shelley’s <em>Mont Blanc</em>; as Shelley’s <em>Triumph of
Life</em>, with equal unconsciousness on the author’s part,
approximates to Leopardi’s first important poem, the
<em>Appressamento alla Morte</em>. They had here a common
model in Petrarch.</p>

<p>Leopardi’s poems, though the majority are in blank
verse, may generally be defined as canzoni, either odes
in the strict sense of the term, addresses to friends, impassioned
outpourings of lonely thought akin to Wordsworth’s
“Tintern Abbey,” or apostrophes to inanimate
objects, such as the moon, the natural friend of the
melancholy poet, or the Vesuvian broom-plant, already
mentioned. A few pieces, such as <em>Il Primo Amore</em>, <em>Il
Risorgimento</em>, are autobiographical; in these Leopardi
usually adopts <em>terza rima</em> or the ordinary rhymed metres.
Personal as these pieces are in subject, they are not
really more subjective than the rest. Leopardi is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span>
devoid of inventive power: the wandering shepherd of
Asia, mouthpiece for one of his finest poems, is the
author in everything but costume. Three of the most
celebrated odes, <em>To Italy</em>, <em>On the Florentine Monument to
Dante</em>, and <em>To Angelo Mai on the Recovery of Cicero De
Republica</em>, may be styled patriotic; but although the love
of Italy is clearly and eloquently expressed, the scorn of
her actual condition, the fault of no one then breathing,
is so bitter and contumelious that the effect is anything
but Tyrtæan. These are nevertheless masterpieces of
noble diction, and little short of miraculous for the age
of twenty, at which they were produced. It is perhaps a
defect that lines are frequently left unrhymed, and that
the ear is thus defrauded of an anticipated satisfaction.</p>

<p>Leopardi’s blank verse is the finest in Italian literature.
If it has neither the “wood-note wild” of Shakespeare’s
sweetest passages, nor the voluminous harmony of
Milton’s organ-music, nor the dainty artifice of Tennyson,
it is fully on a par with the finest metrical performances
of Shelley and Coleridge; and perhaps the English
reader could hardly obtain a better idea of it than by
imagining a blending of the manner of Coleridge’s idylls
with that of Shelley’s <em>Alastor</em>. It admits of translation
into English; while an adequate rendering of the strictly
lyrical poems, so smooth and yet so muscular, like the
marble statue of an athlete, would be an achievement of
very great difficulty. Perhaps the following little piece
may convey some idea of Leopardi’s manner in blank
verse. Few are the poems in which a mere triviality has
been made the occasion of a meditation so sublime:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Leopardi’s prose works, his correspondence and philological
essays excepted, are, like his poetry, limited in
extent and in range of subject, but incomparable for
refinement and beauty of form. He deemed a perfect
prose more beautiful and more difficult of achievement
than poetry of like rank, and related to it as the undraped
figure to the figure clothed. The most remarkable of his
prose writings are the Dialogues, which almost all turn
upon the everlasting theme of the misery of mankind,
varied in the exposition with a grace and fanciful
ingenuity recalling the little apologues in Turgenev’s
<em>Senilia</em>. In one, Mercury and Atlas play at ball with the
earth, become light as tinder by internal decay and the
extinction of life; in another, the earth and the moon
compare notes on the infelicity of their respective inhabitants;
in another, Momus and Prometheus descend
to earth to investigate the success of the latter’s philanthropic
inventions, which have answered Momus’s expectations
better than his; in another, Tasso’s familiar
genius promises to make him happy in the only possible
manner, by a pleasing dream. Comparison is continually
suggested with two great writers, Lucian and Pascal, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
Leopardi sustains it worthily. Inferior to Lucian in
racy humour, to Pascal in keenness of sarcasm, he surpasses
both in virtue of the poetical endowment which
nature had utterly denied to them. In form he comes
nearest to Lucian, in spirit to Pascal. Lucian, a healthy
four-square man, robust in common-sense, little given to
introspection and untroubled by sensitiveness, is constitutionally
very unlike Leopardi; but it might be difficult
to establish a closer parallel than between the Italian and
the French recluse; both very sparing but very choice
writers; exquisite scholars in classics and mathematics
respectively; both hopeless pessimists because hopeless
invalids; the keenest and most polished intellects of their
time, and yet further astray on the most momentous
subjects than many a man “whose talk is of bullocks.”
Leopardi has the advantage in so far that his scorn of man
never degenerates into misanthropy, and his negation is
better than Pascal’s superstition.</p>

<p>Leopardi’s strictly ethical writings (<em>Storia del Genere
Umano</em>; <em>Parini</em>, or <em>On Glory</em>; <em>Bruto Minore</em>; <em>Filippo Ottonieri</em>)
are necessarily devoid of imaginative form, and
hence want the peculiar charm of his Dialogues, but are
not inferior in classical finish. They bring out a more
serious defect of his thought than even his pessimism&mdash;his
ultra-hedonism in definition of happiness as a succession
of momentary pleasurable emotions, each to be enjoyed
as something complete in itself without reference to antecedents
or consequences. This theory, said to have
originated with Aristippus of Cyrene, is precisely that
put forth by Walter Pater at the beginning of his career,
but afterwards virtually retracted. There is one human
condition, and but one, which it actually does suit, and
that is Leopardi’s own&mdash;the condition of the chronic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>
invalid. To the sufferer whose life is a continual physical
agony, the brief intervals of ease actually are the
utmost bliss he is capable of conceiving, and he may
well be forgiven if he makes a succession of such thrills
of pleasure the ideal of life. From any other point of
view this hedonism is the doctrine of a voluptuary,
which Leopardi assuredly was not. His mode of
thought, nevertheless, increased his infelicity by depriving
him of solace from the anticipation of posthumous
fame, for which, as no ingenuity could prove it a
pleasurable sensation, his hedonistic materialism left no
place. With his low estimate of men, he could repose
little hope in their justice; nor, though perfectly aware
of the supreme literary excellence of his own writings,
could he feel the assurance of their immortality which
is only possible to him who regards the universe as
incarnate Reason. His verdict upon himself and them,
widely at variance with the truth, but logical from his
own point of view, is pathetically summed up in his
epitaph on the imaginary Filippo Ottonieri, his own
ideal portrait: “<em>Here lies Filippo Ottonieri, born for
renown and virtuous deeds; who lived without profit and
died without fame; ignorant neither of his nature nor of
his fortune.</em>”</p>

<p>Many of Leopardi’s detached meditations and aphorisms
evince great subtlety and accuracy of observation,
distorted by his persistent determination to think ill
of the human race as a whole, while amicably and
often affectionately disposed towards its individual
members. His philological writings are those of an
accomplished scholar, but their themes are generally of
minor importance. His letters are frequently most
pathetic in their references to his wretched situation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
which alone can excuse the frequent insincerity of those
addressed to his father. On the whole, his faults and his
virtues are such as to render him the most lively representation
of the Italy of his day, superior to the Italy of
a past age in so far as awakened to a consciousness
of her abject condition, but not yet nerved to struggle
for her redemption.</p>

<p>While Leopardi, although at heart a patriot, was virtually
proclaiming patriotism a phantom, a poet of a
very different cast was assailing abuses and preparing a
better day by dint of humorous indignation and sturdy
hopefulness. The Italy of the time stands between
Leopardi and G<small>IUSEPPE</small> G<small>IUSTI</small> (1809-50) like Garrick
between tragedy and comedy. Giusti’s gifts were less
sublime than Leopardi’s, but not less original. What
Leopardi was to the Italian language in its most classical
form, Giusti was to the peculiar niceties of the most idiomatic
Tuscan. What Leopardi was to the most elevated
description of poetry, Giusti was to political satire. Indeed
he was more, for Leopardi merely carried recognised
form to more consummate perfection, while Giusti’s
style was actually created by him. Rich as Italy had
been in most kinds of humorous and burlesque poetry,
she had achieved little in political satire for very evident
reasons. Campanella and Alfieri had verged upon it;
and Casti’s <em>Animali Parlanti</em> and Leopardi’s <em>Paralipomeni</em>
may, from one point of view, be regarded as political
satires, though rather belonging to the mock-heroic epic.
But no political satirist had yet reached the heart of
the people, partly because few had the courage to make
the attempt, partly because metrical satire was as yet
restricted to refined and artificial forms. The gallantry
with which Giusti, living under the absolute government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[Pg 366]</span>
of Tuscany, itself wholly subservient to Austria, launched
shaft after shaft against the oppressors of his country,
is paralleled by the boldness of the literary innovation
he made in discarding the time-honoured forms of blank
verse and <em>terza rima</em>, and conveying satire in easy and
familiar lyric.</p>

<p>Giusti has been compared to Béranger, but certainly
falls short of the Frenchman as a master of song, while
he has more of the sacred fire of poetical indignation.
The Anacreontic side of Béranger’s genius has no counterpart
in him. As a master of idiomatic Tuscan he stands
alone; but his poems require a glossary, and what helps
his fame with his countrymen hinders it with foreigners.
His satires are sometimes called forth by the occurrences
of the day, but are more frequently directed at some persistent
evil or misfortune of the country; and although
the expulsion of the foreigner and his vassals is the
idea most commonly in the background, not a few of the
best pieces treat of the defects of the Italian people itself,
the frivolity of some classes of society, the ignorance
and superstition of others, and not least the pretentious
emptiness of much modern liberalism. The general
tone of Giusti’s compositions is easy and humorous; but
under the impulse of emotion he is capable of rising into
high poetry, as in the description of the corruption of
Florentine society in his <em>Gingillino</em>, or in the palinode to
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, when (October 1847) the
poet for a moment believed that Leopold was about to
pursue a liberal course.</p>

<p>Giusti would have found it difficult to reconcile this
attitude with the aspirations for the unity of Italy which
he had expressed in his <em>Stivale</em> in 1836, but it soon
appeared that Leopold’s constitutionalism was of a piece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
with the monastic inclinations attributed to invalid
devils, and Giusti went back into opposition, more
annoyed and dispirited by the follies and vagaries of
his own party than by the iniquities of the enemy.
The French Revolution of February 1848 gave the
upper hand to the Tuscan liberals, who had superabundantly
manifested their incapacity ere, in March
1849, the fate of Tuscany was decided on the battlefield
of Novara. The heart-broken poet, already suffering
from grievous illness, could not survive until the
better day, dying on 31st March 1850. <em>Chi dura vince.</em>
His profession had been that of an advocate, and,
until his last days, his life was uneventful except for
an unfortunate attachment. It certainly speaks for the
lenity of the Tuscan Government that he should not
have spent much of it in prison, for his satires from
1833 to 1847 circulated widely in manuscript, and some
were printed in Switzerland in his lifetime. They must
suffer with posterity for their general relation to temporary
circumstances; but Giusti will ever retain the
honour of having been the first to apply ordinary Italian
speech to the poetical expression of new ideas and new
needs, thus enlarging the domain both of language and
of literature.</p>

<p>The best English translations from Giusti are the
brilliant renderings by Mr. W. D. Howells, especially
that of the striking poem of <em>St. Ambrose</em>, where an
Italian is represented as moved to sympathy with the
Austrian soldiers by the beauty of</p>

<p class="p1">Affinities with Browning may be observed in these

<p>Another popular poet claims a high and exceptional
place in Italian letters, not so much from his poetical
gift as from his vivid and uncompromising realism. The
peculiar domain of G<small>IOACCHINO</small> B<small>ELLI</small> (1791-1863) is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[Pg 369]</span>
the populace of Rome, whose humours, joys, and
tragedies he has made his own. He has indeed competitors,
but, as his editor Morandi observes, these are
but as rivers to the sea in comparison with the fabulous
opulence of Belli, who has depicted the life around him
in more than two thousand sonnets, each in its way a
little masterpiece. Almost all represent some scene in
the life of the people, observed in his daily ramble, and
versified upon his return home. For spirit and truth to
nature most of them are almost comparable to Theocritus’s
portrait of Praxinoe, and there is probably not
another instance in the world of the life of a great city
so perfectly delineated in verse, or of such an enormous
collection of sonnets of so high an average of merit. The
drawback to their general enjoyment is their inevitable
composition in the Roman dialect, lively, coloured, and
full of comic phrases, but uncouth and corrupt. Another
important division of Belli’s work is the political sonnet,
full of mordant satire on the abuses of the Papal government
under Gregory XVI., not the less veracious because
the author wished to recall it when the Catholic in him
ultimately overcame the Liberal.</p>

<p>The patriotic work of Giusti and of Belli was thus in
a measure local; one took charge of Tuscany, and the
other of Rome. Another distinguished man took all
Italy (the impossible kingdom of the Two Sicilies excepted)
for his province, and deserves to be enumerated
among the more eminent Italian writers of the nineteenth
century who have powerfully contributed to the regeneration
of their country. P<small>IETRO</small> G<small>IORDANI</small> (1774-1848)
is nevertheless not a great author, and perhaps his
highly interesting correspondence is the only portion of
his writings which will retain a permanent value. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[Pg 370]</span>
he was almost the mainspring of the literary movement
of his time. Italian authors resorted to him for ideas, as
English authors resorted to Samuel Rogers for breakfasts,
and neither went empty away. But for him
Leopardi might have wasted his life on classical philology
and verbal criticism; he helped Manzoni and
Giusti to their fame; he lived familiarly with Niccolini,
Capponi, and Colletta, and was the intimate friend of
Monti and Canova. The first forty years of his life,
spent in various official employments, had been troubled
and needy, but he ultimately inherited a fortune, and
during the Thirty Years’ Peace his activity incessantly
pervaded Italian letters like an unseen sap, save when he
came forward to promote a savings-bank or an infant-school,
or got himself expelled from the territories of
some petty prince. His style is highly finished and
polished, but is the chief recommendation of his writings,
the epistolary excepted.</p>

<p>Finally, among the more distinguished authors of the
period who systematically laboured for the deliverance
and regeneration of their country must be named two
most illustrious men, both called upon to deal with
practical affairs, yet chiefly efficacious through their writings,
V<small>INCENZO</small> G<small>IOBERTI</small> and G<small>IUSEPPE</small> M<small>AZZINI</small>. Both
were subjects of the King of Sardinia&mdash;Gioberti a royal
chaplain at Turin; Mazzini a man of letters at Genoa
writing essays in defence of the romantic school. Both
were incarcerated and banished&mdash;Gioberti through the
animosity of the Jesuits, Mazzini as a Carbonaro. Gioberti
betook himself to France, Mazzini to England.
Gioberti soon obtained an European reputation by his
philosophical writings, but does not appear to have
materially influenced French opinion in favour of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[Pg 371]</span>
country. Mazzini, on the other hand, produced great
effects by his mission to England, where the “swift, yet
still, Ligurian figure; merciful and fierce; true as steel,
the word and thought of him limpid as water” (Carlyle),<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
fascinated the best men and women, and made the emancipation
of Italy a cause dear to the heart of the people.
On the other hand, he misused the liberality of his
friends by promoting a number of petty revolts and
foolish expeditions which commonly ended in the destruction
of all who participated in them.</p>

<p>Gioberti accomplished infinitely more for the national
cause by his great book, <em>Il Primato d’Italia</em> (1845),
which dissuaded Italy from abortive conspiracies, and
preached spiritual as a preparation for political unity.
It also, by its own merits and the reputation which
the author had already gained as a thinker, compelled
men of intellect to look into her case. Unfortunately,
Gioberti had not grasped the necessity of absolute administrative
concentration, and advocated confederacy
among the various Italian states; an idea irreconcilable
with that of unity, and moreover utterly impracticable
on account of the centrifugalism of the sovereigns concerned.
This made it possible for Gioberti, when at
length he had himself become minister at Turin, to
propose that Piedmont should anticipate the inevitable
restoration of the sovereigns of Central Italy by Austria
or France by restoring them herself; a step which would
have ruined the house of Savoy in public opinion, and
consequently have destroyed all hope of an united Italy.
Gioberti soon retired to Paris, where he died suddenly
in 1852, just as a new chapter of events was opening,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[Pg 372]</span>in which, taught by experience, he would probably have
performed a more efficient part.</p>

<p>It would have been well for the political, though not
the literary reputation of Mazzini if he had died about the
same time in the good odour of the courage and capacity
he had shown in the defence of Rome against the French.
Although he had a great advantage over Gioberti in his
perception of the need of national unity, he was unable to
conceive of this otherwise than under Republican forms.
He was hence almost as ready to thwart the Piedmontese
as to expel the Austrian; he opposed every practical
scheme for the redemption of Italy, from the Crimean
expedition downwards; and his public career down to
his death in 1872 is a series of lamentable mistakes. He
could not see that his mission was performed when he
had once breathed life into the dry bones, and he had
no appreciation of the practical genius of a man like
Cavour, fully as indispensable to the common cause as
his own ideal enthusiasm. Happily there was another
and more extensive field in which this enthusiasm was
perfectly in place. Mazzini was much more than a conspirator,
more even than a patriot. As a man of letters,
he concerned himself with German, English, and Slavonic
literature, and opened up new horizons to Italian
thought. Polish literature was especially congenial to
him, for at that period its inspiration came from worlds
beyond mortal ken, and Mazzini, recoiling from the
prosaic common-sense of the eighteenth century, possessed
the vein of mysticism common to contemporaries
otherwise so dissimilar as Lamennais, Balzac, George
Sand, Newman, Mickiewicz. This gave a singular elevation
to his ethical thought. A severe thinker, he meditated
much on human rights and human duties, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[Pg 373]</span>
assigned precedence to the latter. “Think less of your
rights and more of your duties” is the burden of much
ethical admonition addressed, especially during his later
years, to the working classes, and containing some of
the noblest and most dignified teaching to be found in
the world. Mazzini had little sympathy with some of the
more recent developments of democracy; his life had
been one of disinterested privation for great ends, and
he thought little, perhaps too little, of merely material
ameliorations. His mysticism, his austere magnanimity,
and his deeply religious feeling find their most perfect
expression in his noble epistle to the members of the
Œcumenical Council of 1869, which, along with President
Lincoln’s oration on the battlefield of Gettysburg,
crowns the public eloquence of our time; nor needs
the age which has produced two such deliverances to
envy in this respect the age of Pericles.</p>

<p>Time has worked and is working for Mazzini; the fanaticism
and unreason of one side of his character, having
produced no permanent ill effect, fall more and more
into oblivion, or are recognised as the necessary conditions
of his unique gifts. His failings were the failings
of a prophet: little as he was qualified to guide the
movement he had evoked, none but such an one as
he could have brought about the national resurrection
truly described by Mr. Swinburne in the poem where he
as truly hails in Mazzini the third Italian prophet after
Dante and Michael Angelo:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw30">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1"><em>And the third prophet standing by her grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,</span><br />
And her soul caught from his the faith to save:<br />
Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born<br />
Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">There is an ancient story of a princess carried off by
a dragon and confined on a desert island in the most
remote recesses of the ocean, who owed her deliverance
to the joint exertions of three most eminent brothers,
none of whom could have accomplished anything without
the other two. One, an astrologer, discovered the
place of her captivity; the second, a mechanician, made
a winged horse; upon which the third, a soldier, proceeded
to the spot and slew the dragon. In the liberation
of Italy the part of the astrologer fell to Mazzini,
that of the mechanician to Cavour, and that of the
soldier to Garibaldi.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>THE NINETEENTH CENTURY&mdash;MIDDLE PERIOD</small></h2>


<p>Literature, as a rule, must ever be on the side of
liberty, for one conclusive reason among others&mdash;that
liberty is the life of literature. Hence every man of
letters is instinctively a partisan of freedom; and even
should his political or religious opinions drive him to
support a tyranny by which these are protected, or
should he be willing to acquiesce in a despotism which
maintains peace and encourages art, he must yet disapprove
of restraint upon his own productiveness, and
this inevitable concession implies all the rest. Poetry&mdash;and
the remark may in its measure be extended to
every department of intellectual labour implying creation
or even construction&mdash;has been well said to represent
the best and happiest moments of the best and
happiest minds, a virtue and felicity to be understood
as referring solely to the intellectual sphere. That is,
there is no activity so pleasurable as production, or, by
consequence, anything so intolerable as restraint.</p>

<p>The history of European literature for the half-century
following the fall of Napoleon is, therefore, in the main,
that of a force enlisted to contend with the Governments
and the various sinister interests which strove to ignore
the Revolution and restore the state of affairs which
had existed in the eighteenth century. Many illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span>
authors, no doubt, especially in England, more or less
favoured this tendency, but their literary practice was
commonly inconsistent with their political principles.
Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Chateaubriand,
might be reactionary as politicians, but in the literary
sphere they were innovators and iconoclasts. The study
of their writings could not but engender a habit of mind
entirely inconsistent with the deference to authority required
for the perpetuation of the ancient régime in State
and Church. No man, for example, more sincerely deplored
the tendencies of his times than Niebuhr, but he
should have thought of them before he meddled with the
history of Rome. By proving its legendary character, he
had done more to unsettle allegiance to tradition than
could have been accomplished by the wit and malice of
a hundred Heines. We are thus justified in regarding
the literature of the nineteenth century as in the main
a great liberating force, and in the long-run favourable
to sound conservatism also, since it aimed at procuring
that liberty for the human spirit without which
renovation was as impossible as demolition.</p>

<p>If there was any country in Europe where literature
might be expected to be unequivocally on the side
of Liberty, it was Italy; for Italy alone had to reckon
with foreign as well as domestic oppressors. In fact, the
general tendency of Italian literature during the period
under review is more uniformly liberal than that of any
other; but at the same time its expression is more
restrained than that of any other, for the conclusive
reason that an Italian writer could only obtain liberty of
speech at the price of exile. Love of country is, nevertheless,
the dominant thought, which colours it throughout
as the soil colours the flower. The men of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[Pg 377]</span>
genius and most prominent association with the national
movement have been treated of in previous chapters, but
the host of distinguished if less illustrious authors who
must be briefly reviewed in this, was not less animated
with patriotic feeling, and this pervading spirit imparts
to the Italian literature of the period unity and dignity,
and entitles it to a higher place in the general history of
literature than could have been procured for it by the
mere ability of its representatives.</p>

<p>One apparent exception to this generally liberal and
patriotic tendency is not really an exception. The New
Catholic reaction which was a necessary consequence of
the Revolution, whatever it may have been among the
priesthood and the less cultivated classes, was neither
illiberal nor unpatriotic among men of letters. Many of
the most eminent of these were fervent Catholics, and as
such felt themselves in a strait between the claims of religion
and of country. As the head of the Church, the
Pope was entitled to the profoundest veneration, but as
temporal prince, he was as much supported by Austrian
bayonets as any of the rest. Could he be promoted
from this undignified position to that of spiritual King of
Italy by the union of all Italian states into a confederacy
under his auspices? This project, if Utopian, was yet
natural, generous, and in no respect inconsistent with
true patriotic feeling. It broke down from the demonstration
furnished by the course of events of the incompatibility
of Italian confederacy with Italian unity, but,
by the exertions of its opponents, no less than those of
its supporters, it left deep traces upon literature.</p>

<p>This idea was the especial property of Vincenzo
Gioberti, already mentioned among the men to whom
Italian regeneration owes most. Its very fallacy was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[Pg 378]</span>
powerful aid to the popular cause, for it conciliated many
who would have shrunk from openly assailing the Pope’s
secular authority, while at the same time it was not so
obviously unsound as to be incapable of being maintained
in good faith until refuted by the course of events.
Although, nevertheless, Gioberti’s essay on Italy’s spiritual
and intellectual primacy is the most important of his
works, it almost disappears in the mass of the remainder,
treating for the most part of religion, or of moral or
speculative philosophy. Among them was a violent
attack on the writings of the most eminent Italian
philosopher of the age, A<small>NTONIO</small> R<small>OSMINI</small>-S<small>ERBATI</small>
(1797-1855), who in turn accused Gioberti of pantheism.
The great purpose of Rosmini’s philosophy
may be defined to be the perfecting of St. Thomas
Aquinas’s system by expelling the element it had derived
from Aristotle, which in Rosmini’s view led direct to
pantheism and materialism. He laboured hard at this
object all his life, but died before his work was done.
It says much for his genius that one so encumbered
with childish ultramontane notions should have won
the acknowledged rank he holds among the first philosophical
thinkers. He is equally well known as the
founder of a religious Order, the constant antagonist of
the Jesuits, and the author of the <em>Five Wounds of the
Church</em>, an appeal for reform whose honest frankness was
used by his enemies to deprive him of the cardinal’s hat
that had been promised him. His Order still flourishes,
his system is still potent, and his memory, honoured everywhere,
is almost adored in his native place, Roveredo in
the Italian Tyrol.</p>

<p>Another philosopher influential on Italian thought was
G<small>IOVANNI</small> D<small>OMENICO</small> R<small>OMAGNOSI</small> (1761-1835), whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[Pg 379]</span>
importance chiefly consists in his application of philosophy
to legal and political science, and his clear prevision
of the coming deliverance of Italy.</p>

<p>No Italian of his age, perhaps, was more thoroughly
admirable in every respect than T<small>ERENZIO</small> M<small>AMIANI</small>
(1799-1885), an approved patriot, a wise statesman, a
sound and sober thinker in religion and philosophy, an
elegant poet, and a man excellent in every relation of life.
With more angularity of character, he would, perhaps,
have possessed more creative force, and impressed himself
more powerfully on the imagination. The dignified
eloquence of his meditative poetry, usually in blank verse,
and of his discourses, political or academical, is often
very impressive, but the form seems more remarkable
than the substance. Like most of the best Italians of
his day, he spent his youth in exile, his prime in office,
and his old age in study and composition. A good
selection from his voluminous writings has been published
with a memoir by Giovanni Mestica, the editor
of Petrarch.</p>

<p>A connecting link between the thinkers and the historians
is formed by G<small>IUSEPPE</small> F<small>ERRARI</small> (1812-1872).
A disciple of Romagnosi, he imported abstract ideas
into his survey of the revolutions of Italy since the
downfall of the Roman Empire&mdash;a very readable if
not always a very convincing book. Ferrari was also a
distinguished publicist, and an indefatigable pamphleteer
in the cause of his country.</p>

<p>History has been extensively cultivated in Italy during
the nineteenth century; and although many histories
were but popular compendiums, or magnified party
pamphlets, or mere <em>mémoires pour servir</em>, others have
gained for the writers honourable rank among first-class<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[Pg 380]</span>
historians. The most extensive in scale and imposing in
subject are histories by C<small>ARLO</small> B<small>OTTA</small> (1766-1837) of the
American War of Independence and of Italy from 1789
to 1814. The former is the best history of the subject
out of the United States; the latter, though taxed with
partiality, is a great and invaluable work. His continuation
of Guicciardini is of less account. Botta’s style is
severe and dignified; too archaic in diction, and occasionally
deficient in flexibility, but he always writes with
the consciousness of his mission which becomes the
historian. He was a determined enemy of the romantic
school. A Piedmontese by birth, he had been concerned
in the disturbances of the early revolutionary period, and
had made several campaigns in the capacity of an army
surgeon. Become temporarily a Frenchman by the
annexation of Piedmont to France, he had held office
under Napoleon, whom he displeased by his frankness.
After Napoleon’s fall he lived chiefly in France. Though
always a patriot as regarded the independence of Italy,
the melancholy deceptions of revolutionary times led him
at last to deem his countrymen only fit for an enlightened
despotism.</p>

<p>A stancher liberal was P<small>IETRO</small> C<small>OLLETTA</small> (1770-1831)
and an even more eminent historian. A Neapolitan
officer of engineers, he served under Murat, but was,
nevertheless, maintained in his rank by the restored
Bourbons. He was Minister of War under the Constitutional
Government of 1820, and after its overthrow was
for some time imprisoned at Brunn in Austria, where
his health suffered greatly. Upon his release he settled
at Florence, and devoted himself to writing the history of
Naples from the accession of the Bourbon dynasty in
1734 up to 1825. He was wholly inexperienced as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[Pg 381]</span>
author, but succeeded in imparting classic form to his
work by dint of infinite labour and careful imitation
of Tacitus, for which the imperious brevity natural to
him, intensified by the habits of military life, admirably
qualified him. His work is one of the most marrowy
and sinewy of histories, and is especially valuable where
he speaks as an eye-witness. It deals fully with financial
and economical as well as political and military affairs.</p>

<p>Another excellent historian has been almost lost to
Italy by the circumstances attending the publication
of his book. G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ATTISTA</small> T<small>ESTA</small>, an exile in
England, published in 1853 his history of the Lombard
League, at Doncaster, a place better affected to the horse
of Neptune than to the olive of Pallas, and, thus producing
<em>invita Minerva</em>, has been almost ignored. In fact,
he is an admirable historian, lucid and delightful in his
narrative, and his style is so fashioned upon the purest
models, that he might seem to have come straight out of
the sixteenth century. This might be reprehended as
affectation, but the objection, if in any respect well
founded, has no application to the excellent English
version (1877), a book which cannot be too strongly
recommended to historians desirous of acquiring the
pregnant brevity so essential in this age of multiplication
of books to all who would catch and retain the ear of
posterity.</p>

<p>The friend and biographer of Manzoni, and imitator
of his style in a successful novel, <em>Margherita Pusterla</em>,
C<small>ESARE</small> C<small>ANTÙ</small> was a long-lived and industrious, and
consequently a voluminous author. His position is
well marked as almost the only considerable writer of
his time who favoured political and ecclesiastical reaction,
and the resulting unpopularity has led him to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span>
unjustly depreciated as a man of letters; he is always
interesting, always individual, and his principal works,
the <em>History of Italy from 1750 to 1850</em> and his <em>History
of Italian Heretics</em>, though disfigured by party spirit,
are important books. The latter is still the standard
authority on the subject, though it will hardly be allowed
to continue so.</p>

<p>An unique position among Italian historians is occupied
by M<small>ICHELE</small> A<small>MARI</small> (1805-89), the Orientalist and national
historian of Sicily. Detesting the Neapolitan oppression
of his native island, he look up the investigation of the
Sicilian Vespers, and depicted this great event as not
the consequence of a conspiracy subtly organised by
John of Procida, but as a spontaneous uprising against
intolerable oppression. The allusion did not escape the
Neapolitan Government, and Amari found it expedient
to withdraw to Paris, where he studied Arabic as a preparation
for his yet more important <em>History of Sicily
under Moslem Dominion</em>, published between 1854 and
1872. In the interim he had taken part in the Sicilian
insurrection, and after the final expulsion of the Bourbons,
was successively Minister of Public Instruction
and professor of Arabic at Florence, continuing to
write and edit books on his favourite subjects. No
historian has a higher reputation for erudition and
sagacity.</p>

<p>G<small>IUSEPPE</small> M<small>ICALI</small> (1780-1844) devoted himself to a
subject even more difficult than Amari’s, and one incapable
of an authoritative solution of its numberless
problems. His <em>Storia degli Antichi Popoli Italiani</em> is
nevertheless a highly important work, which exploded
much error, if it did not establish much truth.</p>

<p>A Neapolitan, C<small>ARLO</small> T<small>ROYA</small> (1784-1858) was to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[Pg 383]</span>
written the History of Italy in the Middle Ages from
476 to 1321, which by his method of working might have
required forty volumes, but he only arrived at Charlemagne
and only filled sixteen. The book is, as Settembrini
remarks, a thesaurus rather than a history, but
cannot be opened without encountering valuable information
and judicious criticism. Troya loved the
Middle Age without idolising it; his liberal opinions,
much against his will, made the indefatigable bookworm
a Minister under one of the ephemeral Neapolitan constitutions,
and there was sense as well as wit in the reply
of the restored Ferdinand when advised to arrest him:
“No! leave him in the Middle Ages!”</p>

<p>Three distinguished statesmen of the nineteenth century,
Cesare Balbo, Gino Capponi, and Luigi Carlo
Farini, respectively wrote histories of much worth;
Balbo an abridged history of Italy, and Capponi one
of the Florentine republic, while Farini chronicled the
transactions of the States of the Church from 1814 to
1850. Farini’s is the most important and authoritative
of these works, as he has made the field entirely his
own. Balbo and Capponi, however, patricians and men
of wealth, did even more for historical studies by their
encouragement and pecuniary assistance than by their
own writings. The great Ministers, Cavour, Ricasoli,
and Minghetti claim a place in literary history as orators
and pamphleteers.</p>

<p>For some reason difficult to understand, biography
has not of late flourished in Italy. No country is so
much overrun with little ephemeral memoirs of little
ephemeral people, and there are many extremely valuable
studies of particular episodes in the lives of celebrated
men, of scientific rather than literary merit. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[Pg 384]</span>
very important works of Villari, Pasolini, and Solerti
belong to a later period than that now under review,
which possesses only two biographies of decided literary
pretensions, both autobiographic.</p>

<p>So important was the public career of M<small>ASSIMO
D’</small>A<small>ZEGLIO</small> (1798-1866), a fervent patriot, but also a
prudent statesman, for nobility of character second to
no contemporary, that his memoirs might have been
expected to have been very serious. On the contrary,
they are eminently lively and gay, in part, perhaps,
from their terminating at the beginning of 1846, before
the author’s heaviest cares had come upon him.
G<small>IUSEPPE</small> M<small>ONTANELLI</small> (1813-62), one of the triumvirs
in the inauspicious Tuscan revolution of 1849, though
equally honest, was entirely deficient in the ballast that
steadied D’Azeglio. But his very levity and inconstancy
lend vivacity to his memoirs of the Tuscan affairs of
his time, and the paradoxes of his character, faithfully
depicted by himself, make a striking and memorable
portrait. His style is unequal, but excellent when at
its best.</p>

<p>N<small>ICCOLÓ</small> T<small>OMMASEO</small>, a Dalmatian (1802-74) forms
a connecting link between history and <em>belles-lettres</em>.
With marvellous versatility he essayed history, politics,
moral and speculative philosophy, biography, philology,
criticism and poetry, distinguishing himself in all without
producing great or enduring work in any. His greatest
distinction, perhaps, was attained as an Italian grammarian
and lexicographer; but as a critic he wielded
great authority, and powerfully contributed to the
development of literature. He was essentially the man
of his own times, and seemed to resume their various
aspects in himself, a sound Catholic and an ardent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[Pg 385]</span>
liberal; a classicist and a romanticist; a conservative
and an innovator; impetuous yet moderate in his aims;
frequently inconsistent with himself, yet ever controlled
by an austere sense of duty; a fine and even brilliant
writer, who yet could achieve no durable work. His
account of his exile at Corfu, nevertheless, deserves to
live for its style, although the theme is insufficient.
Tommaseo was a man of marked character, disinterested,
independent and impracticable; rejecting the
public honours which he had well earned by his share
in the defence of Venice, he spent his later years at
Florence, where, although totally blind, he worked indomitably
to the last. He should be endeared to
England as the author of the fine inscription placed
upon the house of Elizabeth Barrett Browning.</p>

<p>The history of Italian poetry during the post-Napoleonic
era, after deducting the great names of Leopardi
and Giusti, is in the main the history of the romantic
school. It has been remarked that this school is not
congenial to the Italian genius, and that its temporary
prevalence could only occur through the decay of the
classical tradition and the inevitable reaction from the
excesses of the Revolution. It was further prejudiced
in Italian eyes by the ecclesiastical colouring which it
could not help assuming. Most of the literary youth
of Italy, though they might not be bad Catholics, were
still better patriots, and although their compositions
might be influenced by Scott and Goethe, were utterly
averse to the mediæval development which the romantic
idea was receiving in France and Germany. This was
particularly the case with the first poet of eminence
who imbibed romantic feeling from Manzoni and broke
entirely with the already attenuated classicism of Monti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[Pg 386]</span>
and Foscolo. G<small>IOVANNI</small> B<small>ERCHET</small> (1783-1851), although
of French descent, was a devoted Italian patriot, whose
first works of importance were published in London,
where he had been obliged to seek refuge. He began
by denouncing the conduct of the English Government
towards the people of Parga, and followed this up by a
succession of stirring ballads, mostly of patriotic tendency,
and a longer poem, <em>Fantasie</em>, a vision of the past
glories of the Lombard League. In style these poems
resemble the romantic poetry of Germany and England,
without a vestige of classical influence, but also with no
trace of the worship of the past, except as an example to
the present, or anything of the mystic spirit of genuine
romanticism. Well timed as they were, their effect was
extraordinary; but whether antique or contemporary in
subject, they were essentially poems of the day, and such
poetry cannot continue to be read unless it attains the
level of Manzoni’s ode on the death of Napoleon and
Tennyson’s on the death of Wellington. This Berchet
knew. “My aim was not,” he said on one occasion,
“to write a fine poem, but to perform a fine action.”
His style is consequently defective; his poetry was not
written to be criticised, but to inspire and inflame, and
fully answered its purpose. “He has found,” says Settembrini,
“all the maledictions that can possibly be hurled
against the foreigner.” Upon Charles Albert’s conversion
to the national cause, Berchet returned to Italy, and
died a member of the Sardinian Parliament, universally
honoured and beloved, nor will his countrymen forget
him.</p>

<p>“Accursed,” adds Settembrini, “be the Italian who
forgets G<small>ABRIELE</small> R<small>OSSETTI</small>.” Rossetti (1785-1854)
assuredly will not be forgotten by England, for which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[Pg 387]</span>
he has done what no other inhabitant of these isles ever
did in begetting two great poets. His claims to the
gratitude of his countrymen are of quite another sort,
resting chiefly upon the spirit and fluency of his political
poems, which helped to keep the flame of patriotism alive
at home, while the exiled author was teaching Italian at
King’s College. His life is well known as an appendage
to the biography of his more celebrated son. It is one
of the most interesting speculations imaginable what
kind of poetry Dante Gabriel Rossetti would have
written if he had been born and brought up in Italy;
certain it is that no prefigurement of his singular alliance
of purity and transparency of feeling with intricacy of
thought and opulence of illustration, or of his objectivity
and marvellous pictorial gift, is to be found in his father’s
simple, natural, rather overfluent verse. The elder Rossetti
may, nevertheless, be ranked among the poets of
the romantic school; and a similar place belongs to the
amiable Luigi Carrer (1801-53) on account of his ballads,
the most successful of his works. Francesco dall’ Ongaro,
a good lyric poet in other departments, applied the popular
<em>stornello</em> to the purposes of patriotic poetry with
eminent success.</p>

<p>Two poets of more importance enjoyed for a time
great renown, but their reputation, without becoming
extinct, has considerably declined. G<small>IOVANNI</small> P<small>RATI</small>
(1815-54), a native of the Italian Tyrol, gained great
reputation in 1841 by a narrative poem in blank verse,
<em>Edmenegarda</em>, founded upon a tragic event in the family
of the great Venetian patriot Daniele Manin. It is a
poor apology for adultery, but in sentimentality, though
not in morality, belongs to the school of Lamartine,
whose <em>Jocelyn</em> was then at the meridian of its celebrity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[Pg 388]</span>
In consequence, notwithstanding much real poetical
merit, it bears that fatal impress of the boudoir which
disfigures so much of the best pictorial as well as
poetical work of the time. Its success encouraged
Prati to produce several volumes of lyrics, spirited,
melodious, but too fluent. His facility, like Monti’s,
approached the faculty of improvisation, but Monti’s
tawny torrent has shrunk in Prati into a silver rill,
equally swift but by no means equally majestic. He
is nevertheless a poet, and in a particular manner the
poet of the brief interval of hope and joy which accompanied
the uprising of 1848. The national feeling of the
time remains embodied in these verses, the most permanently
valuable of his writings; for the more imaginative
and ambitious productions of his later years, such as
<em>Satana e le Grazie</em> or <em>Armando</em>, though interesting, belong
to the fundamentally unsound <em>genre</em> of adaptation from
<em>Faust</em>.</p>

<p>Another poet once in the enjoyment of a popularity
which he has failed to retain is A<small>LEARDO</small> A<small>LEARDI</small>
(1812-78). He has too much elegance and feeling to
be forgotten, but wants force; his general attitude seems
not inaccurately indicated in his own description of his
heroine Arnalda da Roca as she appeared in the act of
blowing up a shipload of Turks:</p>

<p class="p1 center">“Placidamente <em>fulminò la palla</em>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The expression is rarely at the height of the sentiment
to be expressed. If this can be overlooked, the reader
who does not wish his emotions to run away with him
may find much to admire in the languid grace of the
poems, generally descriptive, didactic or idyllic, which
form the most important part of Aleardi’s work. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span>
rather a reproach than an honour to his patriotic lyrics
that their strong point should be not eloquence but
description, which is always excellent.</p>

<p>The reputation of the good priest and good patriot,
G<small>IACOMO</small> Z<small>ANELLA</small> (1820-89), has, on the contrary, gone
on increasing, and with justice, for his verse is usually at
the level of his thought, and his thought, if more frequently
graceful than striking, sometimes attains a commanding
elevation, as in his odes to Dante and on the
opening of the Suez Canal. His <em>Psyche</em> and <em>Egoism
and Charity</em> are clearly and exquisitely cut as Greek
gems. Zanella’s speciality, however, is his effort to ally
science with poetry, and though he cannot always prevail
upon them to shake hands, one of his lyrics of this
character, <em>The Vigil</em>, a meditation upon Evolution from
a theologian’s point of view, is perhaps his masterpiece.
Another very striking poem is the colloquy between
Milton and Galileo, in which Galileo’s dread of the sceptical
tendency of the science to which he has imparted
such an impulse is represented as determining Milton
“to justify the ways of God to man.” Zanella, a native
of the Vicenzan district, was a gentle, tender, melancholy
man, not unlike Cowper, and his reason, under
the stress of domestic affliction, at one time seemed in
danger of suffering the same eclipse. Recovering, he
forsook the career of college professor for a cottage near
Vicenza, where:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">

<p class="p1">
<em><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Dopo sparsi al vento</span><br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">This retirement, nevertheless, produced some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span>
Zanella’s most delicate poetry, comprised in his dainty
little volume <em>Astichello ed altre Poesie</em>, not yet included
in his works. One of the most beautiful of his poems,
<em>The Redbreast</em> (<em>Il Pettirostro</em>), marvellously resembles the
idylls of Coleridge, with whose works Zanella betrays
his acquaintance. Charming, also, are the sonnets celebrating
the various aspects of the local river, the little
Astichello, such as this upon the sympathy between man
and Nature in time of drought, a “pathetic fallacy,”
perhaps, but none the worse for that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Zanella might have applied to himself the proud
humility of Musset, <em>Mon verre n’est pas grand, mais je bois
dans mon verre</em>. His modest strain was independent of
traditional or contemporary influence. The other poets
of the time are more historically significant as representing
the decadence of the romantic school. A new
development was urgently required to make good its
exhausted vitality. The problem was solved much in
the same way as that of the renovation of the operatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
stage, left void by the once brilliant but now moribund
school of Rossini, save that in that instance the evening
star of the old dispensation was also the morning star of
the new. No such Janus-Verdi arose upon poetry, but
the man for the occasion was found in the principal
figure of our next chapter, Giosuè Carducci.</p>

<p>The drama of the period has only one eminent representative,
P<small>IETRO</small> C<small>OSSA</small> (1830-80), and his works, strictly
speaking, fall somewhat later. Cossa, though fine both in
versification and rhetoric, is essentially more of a playwright
than of a poet, but half redeems his deficiencies
by a quality not too common on the tragic stage of our
day, masculine strength. Almost every scene is powerful,
the action rarely halts or lingers, there is never any
room for doubt as to the author’s intention, and the
language is energetic without bombast. Cossa’s shortcomings
are mainly in the higher region of art. He has
little creative power, and although he is occasionally
felicitous in the invention of a minor character, he
rarely ventures to travel beyond the record in the
delineation of the historical personages who form the
most important portion of his dramatic flock. There
is no penetration, no subtlety, nothing to manifest endowment
with any insight beyond the ordinary. As
conventional representations, however, Cossa’s characters
are brilliant, and he may even be accused of
excess in the accumulation of historical traits, as though
he could not bear to part with an anecdote. <em>Nero</em>,
<em>Messalina</em>, <em>Cola di Rienzo</em>, <em>The Borgias</em>, <em>Cleopatra</em>, <em>Julian
the Apostate</em> are among the most remarkable of his
numerous historical tragedies; if not great plays or
dramatic poems, they are, at all events, very splendid
historical masquerades. There is more originality in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span>
his one comedy, <em>Plautus and his Age</em>, a lively picture
of Roman society in Plautus’s time.</p>

<p>The period immediately preceding the establishment
of Italian unity brought forth many novels, mostly of
the Manzonian school. The most important of these
have been already mentioned. F<small>RANCESCO</small> D<small>OMENICO</small>
G<small>UERAZZI</small> (1804-73), of infelicitous memory as a politician,
had sufficient force as an historical novelist to
deviate from the Manzonian model, and to obtain for
a while an European reputation with his <em>Battle of Benevento</em>,
<em>Siege of Florence</em>, and <em>Pasquale Paoli</em>. He was a
man of powerful but unregulated character, and the
inequality extends to his writings; his diction is extolled,
his style condemned. Italian fiction had a serious loss
in Ippolito Nievo, drowned on his return from Garibaldi’s
expedition to Sicily. “Perhaps,” says Vernon Lee, “no
better picture could be given of Italy in the last years
of the eighteenth century than that contained in Nievo’s
<em>Confessioni di un Ottuagenario</em>.”</p>

<p>The literary period which we have been traversing in
the last two chapters may be approximately described as
that extending from the fall of Napoleon the First (1814)
to the intervention of Napoleon the Third in Italian
politics (1859). It saw the later works of Monti and
Foscolo, all the chief productions of Manzoni, and everything
of Leopardi’s. Apart from these, it produced no
great genius, but a number of highly distinguished writers
who did honour to their own literature without producing
any marked effect upon the literatures of foreign
nations. The main reason of this circumscription of
Italian influence was the legitimate preoccupation of
Italy with her own affairs. The main aspiration of every
Italian breast was the expulsion of the foreigner and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[Pg 393]</span>
constitution of the national unity, whether as monarchy,
federation, or republic. This common thought gave a
noble unity to the authorship of the period, but could
not materially affect contemporary literatures, although
Mazzini’s English writings, Mr. Gladstone’s Neapolitan
pamphlets, Sydney Dobell’s <em>Roman</em>, Mrs. Browning’s
<em>Casa Guidi Windows</em> and <em>Poems before Congress</em>, and
divers poems of Robert Browning, and Algernon Swinburne,
and Dante Rossetti, show that England was
not uninfluenced by it. In the next generation, Italian
letters, though, except for the poets Carducci and
D’Annunzio, rather retrograding than advancing in
merit, became more influential by becoming more
cosmopolitan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<small>CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN LITERATURE</small></h2>


<p>The present age of letters in Italy resembles its contemporary
literary epochs in the one respect in which these
agree among themselves and differ from most preceding
ages; it is an age of literary anarchy. No standard of
taste exists to which it is deemed essential to conform,
and antipathetic schools flourish comfortably, if not
always peaceably, side by side. This was the case
with the Greek schools of philosophy under the Roman
Empire, but in literature has rarely happened before the
nineteenth century. At almost all former periods some
prevailing canon of taste has stamped the literary productions
of the era with its own signet, and the most
celebrated authors of the day have legislated for the rest.
The Goethes, the Victor Hugos, the Tennysons of our
time, while powerfully affecting contemporary thought,
have failed to thus impress their image and superscription
on contemporary style. Scepticism which at
former periods would have horrified the coævals of
Pope or Bembo, is audaciously professed with regard
to the merits of greater men; and whereas, in former
ages, admiration meant imitation, some of the sincerest
votaries of a Hugo or a Browning would be farthest
from attempting to reproduce their mannerisms. It is
quite true that the endeavour is still sometimes made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[Pg 395]</span>
erect individual tastes and distastes into articles of faith,
that we are confidently told that such a writer or such
a form of art is hopelessly antiquated, and that such
another is accepted by the right-minded. But this dogmatism
is invariably an expression of individual taste,
and has no real substance and no permanence. The
change cannot but be salutary if, as we believe, it is in
the main an effect of the expansion of the area of
knowledge. The class of intelligent readers is now
so greatly enlarged that the legislation of academies
and the verdict of coteries reach comparatively but a
little way; readers think for themselves more than
they did of old; and if the public taste is less disciplined
than formerly, it is in less danger of being
biassed in one direction. It may be added that the
armistice between the classic and romantic schools, consequent
upon the proved inability of each to subdue
the other, has demonstrated the impossibility of any
infallible æsthetic criterion. Men disputed what this
criterion might be, and different conceptions of it prevailed
in different ages, but the existence of some definite
standard entitled to exact conformity was questioned
by none. Now it is generally recognised that men are
born classicists or romanticists, as they have been said
to be born Platonists or Aristotelians, and that the right
course for every author is to cultivate his powers in
whatsoever direction Nature has assigned to them, and
for every reader to strive to appreciate excellence whencesoever
it comes. The result is life, spirit, energy, but a
commotion as of tossing billows, which may or may not
eventually settle down into the calm of an accepted theory
of art.</p>

<p>We cannot speak in Italy more than elsewhere of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[Pg 396]</span>
great writer as ruling his age and prescribing laws to his
contemporaries. Individual genius, however, is no less
effective than of old upon those constitutionally in sympathy
with it, and no gifted writer can introduce a
new style without enlisting disciples and provoking antagonists.
Such a genius and such a style appertain to
G<small>IOSUÈ</small> C<small>ARDUCCI</small> (born 1836), the one contemporary
poet of Italy who, if we except Gabriele d’Annunzio,
“in shape and gesture proudly eminent,” stands forth
like a tower from the rest, and who has made an abiding
reputation as the introducer of the new elements needed
to replace the expiring impulse of the romantic school.
Like many of his compeers, Carducci partakes of both
classic and romantic elements; romantic in his revolt
against convention, classic in his worship of antique
form; and it is in great measure this duality which
renders him so important and interesting.</p>

<p>Carducci, far from being the literary dictator of his
age, is perhaps not less distasteful to the ultra-realists for
whom he paved the way, than to the romanticists whom
he overthrew, yet is in a very special sense the representative
of his age and nation. The commencement of
poetical activity synchronised with a new dispensation
in the world of politics. The reviving nation must have
a new poet or none. Egypt was plainly unfit to sing the
songs of Sion. The submission of Manzoni, the despair
of Leopardi, had in their respective ways well suited an
age of slavery; but the age of liberty had now arrived,
and craved strains combative, resonant, and joyous.
The Pope’s obstinate clinging to the temporal power
also compelled the national poet to be anti-clerical.
Neither Carducci’s political nor his religious views wanted
anything essential to the effectual fulfilment of his mis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[Pg 397]</span>sion:
that their vehemence sometimes transgressed the
limits of good sense and good taste would probably now
be acknowledged by himself. It was equally important
that the form should correspond to the feeling. The new
spirit sought a new body. Carducci solved the problem
in the same manner as Chiabrera would have solved it
two centuries and a half before, had Chiabrera’s genius
equalled his discernment. He perceived that in the
circumstances of his day a return to classic models
would be no retrogression, but renovation for Italian
poetry: unfortunately he had no true insight into the
classical spirit. This Carducci possessed, and there are
few happier examples of the alliance of one literature
with another than the poems, the most important part
of his work, in which he has kept classical examples
steadily before him. The imitation, it must be understood,
is one of form and not of essence; the themes
are but occasionally classical, and even when this is
the case express the feelings of a modern Italian spirit.
Imitate classical forms as the poet may, he is essentially
the man of the nineteenth century: his variety of mood
and theme is great; his orchestra has a place for every
instrument; but in nine cases out of ten the direction
to the performer is <em>con brio</em>. By this dashing vigour
Carducci has poured new blood into the exhausted
veins of Italian poetry, and administered an antidote
to her besetting maladies by the example of a style
condensed, nervous, and terse to a fault. Epic or
dramatic power he does not claim: his genius is entirely
lyrical.</p>

<p>Carducci’s first volume appeared in 1857, and the
events of the following years called forth a number
of occasional poems, clearly indicating the representa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[Pg 398]</span>tive
poet of the people and the time. In 1865, the
vigorous “Hymn to Satan” provoked the controversy
which the poet had no doubt designed. His Satan,
it hardly need be said, is not the monarch of the fallen
seraphim, but the spirit of revolt against social and
ecclesiastical tyranny, more of a Luther than a Lucifer.
<em>Levia Gravia</em> (1867) greatly extended the poet’s reputation.
<em>Odi Barbare</em> (1877) excited a literary controversy
almost as virulent as the theological. The splendour
of the diction was beyond question, but what was to
be said to the novel or exotic forms in which the poet
had thought fit to clothe it? To us, the naturalisation
of the Alcaic and Sapphic metres appears most
successful, although in the former the writer has permitted
himself some deviation from the Horatian
model, and the form is perhaps too deeply impressed
with his own personality to become frequent in
Italian literature. Most of the other forms, including
the hexameters and pentameters, seem to us either
too stiff or too intricate to be quite satisfactorily
manipulated even by Carducci himself; but the study
of them must be a valuable training for practitioners
in more facile metres. If the form be sometimes too
elaborate, there can be no dispute as to the weight and
massive majesty of the sense. Carducci has solved
the problem which baffled the Renaissance, of linking
strength of thought to artifice of form. The <em>Rime
Nuove</em> brought him new laurels, and his poetical career
has paused for the present with a noble ode on the tercentenary
of Tasso in 1895. The jubilee of his connection
with the University of Bologna was celebrated
by a great demonstration in 1896, and, reconciled with
the monarchy which he once opposed, he enjoys the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span>
honour of a Senator of the Kingdom. A Liberal but
a Royalist, a freethinker but a theist, he is happily
placed to exert a reconciling and moderating influence
alike in the political and the intellectual sphere.</p>

<p>The difficulties of translating Carducci’s more characteristic
poems are almost insuperable. He is not in the
least obscure, but his noble and austere form is indissolubly
wedded to the sense, and in reproduction his
bronze too often becomes plaster. Many versions, moreover,
would be required to render justice to the various
aspects of his many-sided genius&mdash;his love of country, his
passion for beautiful form, his Latin and Hellenic enthusiasm,
his photographic intensity of descriptive touch,
his sympathy for honest labour and uncomplaining
poverty, his capacity for caressing affection and scathing
indignation. The following poem powerfully exhibits
his intense devotion to the past, and faith in the future
of his Italy. The subject is the statue of Victory in
the Temple of Vespasian at Brescia; but to appreciate
the full force of the poem, it must be known that
the statue was a recent discovery of happiest augury
(1826), and that Brescia had been the scene of an heroic
defence and a cruel sack in the uprising against the
Austrians in 1848:</p>

<p class="p1">A large proportion of Carducci’s lyrics flow with more
of liquid ease in more familiar metres, better adapted for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[Pg 401]</span>
popularity. This is especially the case with his impassioned
addresses to the dead or to contemporaries who
have won his admiration, and the poems which depict
ordinary life, such as “A Dream in Summer,” “On a
Saint Peter’s Eve,” and “The Mother,” whose apparently
loose but really well-knit texture is admirably reproduced
by his American translator Mr. Sewall, and which are
such pieces as Walt Whitman might have written if he
had been a poet in virtue of his art as well as of his
nature. Perhaps none of the shorter pieces is more
expressive of his profound humanity than his apotheosis
of patient toil under the figure of “The Ox,” ably rendered
by Mr. Sewall, a poem Egyptian in its grave
massiveness and tranquil repose:</p>

<p class="p1">Carducci has rendered his country much service as a
literary critic, especially of the Renaissance, and of the
Risorgimento of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
He is not subtle or profound, but puts forth unanswerably
propositions dictated by the soundest common-sense.
There is something Teutonic as well as Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[Pg 402]</span>
in his composition, and he recalls no precursor so much
as the German poet Platen, an equal master of form; but
Platen, though a real patriot, is more at home with any
nation than his own. It is a chief glory of Carducci to
have united an intensely patriotic spirit to a comprehensive
cosmopolitanism. Though ranging far and wide
to enrich the domestic literature with new metrical forms,
he loves those in which the Italian genius has embodied
itself from days of old, and is always ready to defend
them against degenerate countrymen, no less than
against unappreciative foreigners. Like Wordsworth,
he has simultaneously vindicated and illustrated the
sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">

<p class="p1"><em>Brief strain with much in little rife; whose tone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As worlds untrodden rose upon his thought,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bavius blasphemes; the dearer thence to me.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Carducci’s example could not but create a school of
poets, many of great merit, but most of whom stand to
him more or less in the relation of disciples to a master.
The chief exception is the only one who can claim,
like Timotheus, to “divide the crown,” G<small>ABRIELE
D’</small>A<small>NNUNZIO</small>.</p>

<p>D’Annunzio (born 1863) is a second Marini, endowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[Pg 403]</span>
with an even more brilliant genius, and better armed
against besetting faults. It is terrible to think what
synchronism with Marini might have made of him, but
it has been his good fortune to have had Carducci’s
example before his eyes, and his merit to have profited
by it. At the same time his genius is so distinct from
Carducci’s as to vindicate for him an independent position.
To employ Coventry Patmore’s happy application
of a passage in Zephaniah to the poetic art, D’Annunzio
rather represents “Beauty,” and Carducci “Bands”; the
note of the one is restraint, and that of the other is
exuberance. D’Annunzio’s verse is not cast in bronze
like Carducci’s, nor has he his rival’s splendid virility
or his devotion to ideal interests; his affluence is nevertheless
so well restrained by a natural instinct for form
that it never, as with Marini, becomes riotous extravagance.
Some of the metrical forms, indeed, which,
influenced as may be surmised by Mr. Swinburne, he
has endeavoured to introduce, seem ill adapted to the
genius of the Italian language, though they would probably
succeed well in English. But nothing can be
more satisfactory than the form of his sonnets or of
his ballad-romances, and he has enriched Italian poetry
with one new form of great beauty, the <em>rima nona</em>, a
happy compromise between the terse purity of the
national octave and the rich harmony, like the chiming
of many waters, of the English Spenserian stanza, which
no foreign literature has yet succeeded in acclimatising.
It is also to his honour that, while no writer is
more partial to the employment of unusual words,
commonly derived from science or natural history, the
effect is that of brilliant mosaic without a mosaic’s
rigidity, but soft and liquid as a glowing canvas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span></p>

<p>In many respects D’Annunzio presents a strong affinity
to Keats; but to the innocent sensuousness which rejoices
in the reproduction of sumptuous beauty, he adds
that which purposely ministers to voluptuousness. This
might be forgiven as the failing of a youthful and ardent
poet, and becomes, indeed, much less obtrusive in his later
poetical writings. The misfortune is that nothing seems
to be taking its place. Had years brought D’Annunzio
“the philosophic mind,” had his third volume compared
with its predecessors as <em>Locksley Hall</em> and <em>In Memoriam</em>
compare with the <em>Lotus Eaters</em>, he would be at the head,
not merely of Italian, but of European poets. His most
recent productions, while indicating, as must almost
inevitably be the case, an impoverishment of the merely
sensuous opulence of his youth, manifest but slight
advance in power of thought, in dignity of utterance,
in human or national sympathies, in anything that discriminates
the noon of poetical power from its morning.
The <em>Canto Novo</em> (1881) and the <em>Intermezzo</em> (1883) were
a splendid dawn; and <em>L’Isotteo</em> (1885) and <em>La Chimera</em>
(1888) revealed further development, not indeed in power
of thought, but in objectivity and in mastery of form.
Much of all these volumes is mere voluptuous dreaming,
but the pictures of nature are marvellously vivid; such
pieces as the little unrhymed lyric of twelve lines, <em>O falce
di luna calante</em>, reveal the natural magic which is perhaps
the rarest endowment of genius; and the melody is such
as is only granted to a true poet. In the <em>Poema Paradisiaco</em>,
the joy of life is evidently on the wane, and,
except in a few pieces of exquisite pathos, such as <em>Consolazione</em>,
seems in danger of being replaced, not by a nobler
and more serious theory of life, but by the worst kind
of pessimism, that born of mere satiety. The most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
recent poems, the <em>Odi Navali</em> (1893), though patriotic
in theme, appear tame and artificial in comparison with
earlier work. The epilogue to the <em>Poema Paradisiaco</em>,
nevertheless, argues progress in the right direction, and
leaves room to hope that D’Annunzio may yet take rank
not merely with poets eminent for melody, fancy, and
imagination, but with those who have counted among
the shaping forces of their time.</p>

<p>The general impression of D’Annunzio’s poetry is
one of dazzling splendour and intoxicating perfume.
The poet seems determined to leave no sense ungratified,
and not to omit a hue, an odour, or a cadence that
can by any possibility be pressed into his service. It
says much for the genuineness of his poetical faculty
that he should actually be able to perform this without
falling into extravagance; but although his lavish luxury
of phrase and description is kept within the limits of
taste, the too uniform splendour satiates and fatigues.
Mr. Greene’s translations in his Italian Lyrists convey
a very good notion of D’Annunzio’s most usual manner.
The following sonnet may serve as a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Beneath the white full-moon the murmuring seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Send songs of love across the pine-tree glade;</span><br />
The moonlight filtering through the dome-topped trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fills with weird light the vast and secret shade;</span><br />
A fresh salt perfume on the Illyrian breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From sea-weeds on the rock is hither swayed,</span><br />
While my sad heart, worn out and ill at ease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wild poetic longing doth invade.</span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><em>But now more joyous still the love-songs flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O’er waves of silver sea; from pine to pine</span><br />
A sweet name echoes in the winds that blow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, hovering through yon spaces diamantine,</span><br />
A phantom fair with silent flight and slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiles on me from its great-orbed eyes divine.</span></em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span></p>

<p class="p1">At the same time D’Annunzio has another style, principally
exhibited in his minor lyrics and his ballad
romances, where simple but perfect melody is mated with
hearty vigour. The contrast between Tennyson’s <em>Palace
of Art</em> and his <em>Edward Gray</em> is hardly greater than that
between the brilliant poetical landscape just quoted, and
this joyous <em>aubade</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>While yet the veil of misty dew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conceals the morning flush,</span></em><br />
(How light of foot the foxes’ crew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are scampering in the bush!)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em>On damask bed my Clara spends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In dreams the idle hours:</span></em><br />

<p class="p1"><em>Lift, lovely lady all amort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glory of your head.</span></em><br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">It is manifest that although the Carduccis and D’Annunzios
of the present day may not rank higher as poets than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span>
the Montis and Leopardis of the past, they have done
far more to fit the Italian lyre with new strings, and have
opened up paths of progress formerly undreamed of.
Many of the novel and exotic forms they have introduced
will richly repay cultivation, but the problem will be to
employ the technique acquired by their practice to the
embellishment and elevation of forms more adapted for
general use. This the great master of modern Italian
poetry has seen, and, magnificently as he has handled
the more elaborate harmonies, it is the simple, popular
song that he invokes after all, while incomparably exemplifying
it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw15">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
<em>Cura e onor de’ padri miei,<br />
Tu mi sei<br />
Come lor sacra e diletta.<br />
Ave, o rima: e dammi un fiore<br />
Per l’amore,<br />
E per l’odio una saetta.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Apart from these two chief names Italy possesses at
present a number of excellent lyrical poets. The best
known is perhaps Olindo Guerrini, whose first poems,
<em>Posthuma</em>, supposed to be edited from the papers of
an imaginary Lorenzo Stecchetti, caused a great sensation,
not so much by their unquestionable talent as by
their audacious immorality. Of late years Guerrini has
produced a number of poems on the political circumstances
of the country, many of which are perfect
masterpieces of refined form and energetic expression.
As much may be said for the political verses of the Parliamentary
orator Felice Cavallotti. The poet of the social
revolution is Mario Rapisardi, a Sicilian, known also as
the literary antagonist of Carducci; while the sorrows
of the poor are pathetically expressed by a lady, Ada<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span>
Negri. Alessandro Arnaboldi, lately deceased, possessed
an eminent faculty for description and excelled in grave
and dignified lyric, not unlike Matthew Arnold; while
Italy has her James Thomson in the gloomy and
powerful Arturo Graf. Antonio Fogazzaro, on the other
hand, is the poet of hope and faith. Enrico Panzacchi,
less individual than most of these, surpasses them all
in grace and variety; Edmondo de Amicis, celebrated
as a traveller, has the gift of brilliant description; Luigi
Capuana has emulated Carducci’s metrical experiments;
and excellent poetry has been produced by Giovanni Marradi,
Giuseppe Pascoli, and Alfredo Baccelli. Translated
specimens of these and other poets, with biographical and
bibliographical particulars, will be found in Mr. G. A.
Greene’s <em>Italian Lyrists of To-Day</em>. On the whole, the
present condition of Italian poetry is one of abundant
vitality, but of deficient concentration either in great men
or great poems. The serious drama is best represented
by Cavallotti’s tragedies and the New Testament trilogy
of Giuseppe Bovio, and the humorous by the comedies
of Roberto Bracco and Giacinto Gallina.</p>

<p>The novel is at present as vigorously cultivated in Italy
as in any civilised nation, and the talent it attracts cannot
be altogether devoid of results. No talent, however,
succeeds in permanently naturalising forms of literature
uncongenial to the national mind, and it remains to be
seen whether this is or is not the case with the novel in
Italy. The novelette arose spontaneously, and was maintained
without difficulty; but with every encouragement
from the example of other nations, Italy failed to acclimatise
either romantic fiction or the novel of manners,
until far entered into the nineteenth century. The inference
that lengthy story-telling must be alien to the genius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>
of the people is confirmed by the general inferiority of
modern Italian novelists. One or two, such as Matilda
Serao, Salvatore Farini, and Giulio Barrili, have acquired
a reputation beyond the limits of their own country. One
or two others, such as Antonio Fogazzaro, the leader of
a reaction towards a spiritualistic conception of things;
Carlo Placci, the very promising author of <em>Un Furto</em>;
and Luciano Zuccoli, author of <em>Roberta</em>, have shown
the ability to impress themselves upon the national
literature.</p>

<p>Only two, however, seem to stand forth very decidedly
as masters of fiction. One of them is Gabriele d’Annunzio,
already treated as a poet. D’Annunzio’s novels
have made more noise than his poems, being from
one point of view much more, from another much less,
suited for general perusal. The scandal which has grown
up about them has diverted attention from their real
merits of fine style and conscientious workmanship. As
an artist, D’Annunzio is almost as admirable in prose as in
verse; and if with his descriptive he combined the creative
gift, all his immoralities would not debar him from
permanent renown. Unfortunately, he is like most
French and Italian novelists, monotonously restricted
to the portrayal of a single passion, and his splendid
scenery is the background for trivial characters. He
reminds us of the demon in Victor Hugo’s poem, who
consumes the strength of lions and the wisdom of elephants
in fashioning a locust. This is the besetting sin
of the novelists of France and Italy: with a few brilliant
exceptions on both sides, the English novel lives by character,
the French by situation. D’Annunzio’s novels are
nevertheless important literary events, and cannot be
omitted from any survey of modern European literature.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[Pg 410]</span>
They have already gained him renown and circulation in
France and the United States. The most celebrated are
<em>Il Piacere</em>, <em>Il Trionfo della Morte</em>, <em>La Vergine delle Rocce</em>,
the last of which is exempt from most of the objections
justly urged against the others.</p>

<p>G<small>IOVANNI</small> V<small>ERGA</small> (b. 1840) rivals the European reputation
of D’Annunzio, and is, like him, the head of a realistic
school; but his realism is of quite another sort, owing
nothing to Zola or Maupassant. He is the most eminent
European representative of the local novel, dealing with
the manners, humours, and peculiar circumstances of
some special locality. The vogue of this style was perhaps
originally due to George Sand’s idyllic pictures of Berri.
Verga has found a yet more interesting corner of the world
to delineate. A Sicilian, though residing at Milan, he has
made his native island the scene of his fiction. Centuries
of misgovernment have unhappily accumulated stores of
tragic material in the people’s misery and oppression, and
the ferocity and vindictiveness these have engendered.
Verga depicts these circumstances with the fidelity of a
dispassionate observer and the skill of an artist. His
books not only attract in their own day, but will be
treasured in the future among the most valuable documents
for the social history of Sicily.</p>

<p>Any one of even the minor poets whom we have
enumerated has a chance of reaching posterity, for
their work is at all events individual, and expressive
of the personality of the author. If this is sufficiently
interesting, the work may live, though it be far from
inaugurating a new literary era like Carducci’s. It is
otherwise with the contemporary prose literature of
Italy. A history, a biography, philology like Ascoli’s
or D’Ancona’s, a work on social science like Sella’s or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[Pg 411]</span>
Morselli’s may possess great value as the work of an
expert, even though devoid of individuality; but in this
case it must sooner or later lapse into the category of
books of reference. Such appears to be the case with
most of the excellent work now being done in Italy in
these and other departments: the statue is carved, but
no name is inscribed upon the pedestal, for the sculpture
is the work of a craftsman, not of an artist. Exceptions
may be made in favour of a few writers recently deceased&mdash;Ruggiero
Bonghi, translator of Plato and historian of
Rome, one of the soundest heads in Italy; Giuseppe
Chiarini, champion of Carducci; Enrico Nencioni, lately
lost to his country, a high authority upon English literature;
Angelo de Gubernatis, a brilliant and almost too
versatile critic and philologist; and Giuseppe Guerzoni,
raised above himself by his theme when he wrote the life
of Garibaldi. Among living men, two at least have won
an abiding reputation as writers, apart from the utilitarian
worth of their work&mdash;Pascale Villari, biographer of Savonarola
and Machiavelli, and writer on the social conditions
of the South; and Domenico Comparetti, author of
<em>Virgilio nel Medio Evo</em>. In general, however, the chief
distinction of contemporary writers on serious subjects
seems to be their general diligence and good sense.
Admirable writers have gained European renown for
themselves, and exalted the fame of their country by the
substantial merit of works making no especial pretension
to literary distinction. Thus Ascoli stands high in general
philology; D’Ancona, Tigri, and Rubieri in literary
history; Lanciani and Rossi in archæology; Nitti in
historical research; Pasolini and Solerti in biography;
Cremona in mathematics; Lombroso and Ferrero in
psychology; and Cossa in political economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[Pg 412]</span></p>

<p>These form a galaxy indeed, but belong rather to
learning and science than to literature. This temporary
languor of pure literature may perhaps be accounted for
when it is considered that one main factor of inspiration
has been removed by the contentment of the national
aspirations. The subjection and oppression of the
country, with all their evils, at all events afforded an
intense stimulus to literary genius. Every Italian heart
was possessed by the emotions most conducive to impassioned
composition; and patriotic sentiment, even
when not expressed in words, imbued the whole of
literature. The tension removed, it was perhaps inevitable
that overstrained feelings should decline to
a lower level, which may be suddenly elevated by
the occurrence of some great national crisis, or the
appearance of some genius gifted, like Mazzini and
Carducci, with an especial power of influencing the
young. What Italian letters seem to want above all
things is men, other than poets and novelists, capable
of impressing their own individuality on what they
write, and such men are most readily formed either
by the agitation of stirring times, or by the contagious
enthusiasm caught from a great teacher.</p>

<p>The opinions of many eminent living men of letters
on the future of their country’s literature have been collected
by Signor Ugo Ojetti in his <em>Alla scoperta dei Letterati</em>
(1895). They are not in general of a very encouraging
character, but their weight is considerably impaired by
their almost complete restriction to a single branch of
literature, and that one whose preponderance is by no
means to be desired. Almost all the authors interviewed
by Signor Ojetti are novelists, and, so far as appears from
his reports, would appear utterly unconscious of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[Pg 413]</span>
existence of any class of literature but fiction, poetry, and
the drama. They seem to regard literature and <em>belles
lettres</em> as convertible terms, and take no notice of the
wider and more important domains of history, biography,
philosophy, moral and economic science, which may be
and often have been in the most flourishing condition
while <em>belles lettres</em> languish. It is, indeed, much to be
wished that more of the literary talent of Italy were
directed to solid and permanent work, and less to fiction,
which must be ephemeral in proportion to the very fidelity
with which it fulfils its ordinary task of depicting the
manners of the day. Work like Comparetti’s <em>Virgilio
nel Medio Evo</em>, for example, confers higher distinction on
the national literature than any number of novels, unless
when creations of genius of a high order.</p>

<p>Such genius, when exercised in fiction or in poetry,
does not depend for its manifestation upon the state
of the book market; the really gifted author obeys
an impulse from within. “Genius does what it must,
and talent does what it can.” If modern Italians have
it in them to produce great books, they will not be
prevented by such of the obstacles stated by Signor
Ojetti’s confabulators as may be fairly resolved into
one, the insufficient remuneration of literary work.
It is just to acknowledge, however, the existence of
impediments of another kind. From the earliest period
of letters Italy has suffered from the variance of the
written and the spoken language. The refinements of
cultivated circles at Rome were not accepted in the
provinces: there was a Latin of books and a Latin of
ordinary life. In process of time the former became the
exclusive speech of the learned, while the language of
the vulgar gave birth to a number of dialects, out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[Pg 414]</span>
which, when a vernacular literature came to exist, the
Tuscan was selected as the most appropriate for written
speech. Hence there has always been something artificial
in Italian literary language. Many of the most
gifted authors who happened to be born out of Tuscany
never attained to write it with perfect correctness; and
the jealous care taken to ensure its purity tended to limit
its flexibility and compass. It thus became hardly
adequate to deal with the mass of neologism absolutely
forced upon it by the development of modern
civilisation.</p>

<p>“The difficulty,” says Symonds, “under which a
mother-tongue, artificially and critically fashioned like
Italian, suffers when it copes with ordinary affairs of
modern life, is illustrated by the formation of feeble
vocables, and by newspaper jargon,” of which he gives
a horrible instance. The same critic wrote in 1877:
“Italian has undergone no process of transformation
and regeneration according to the laws of organic
growth since it first started. The different districts
still use different dialects, while writers in all parts of
the peninsula have conformed their style, as far as
possible, to early Tuscan models. It may be questioned
whether united Italy, having for the first time
gained the necessary conditions of national concentration,
is not now at last about to enter on a new phase
of growth in literature, which, after many years, will
make the style of the first authors more archaic than it
seems at present.” The immense difficulty experienced
by so great a writer as Manzoni in reconciling vigour
with purity of diction, and his complaints of the limited
vocabulary at his disposal, seem to prove that these
impediments are not imaginary. Since Symonds wrote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[Pg 415]</span>
however, a view differing in some respects has been
expressed by one of the few living men who may claim
to be regarded as masters of Italian prose, Gabriele
d’Annunzio. In the dedicatory preface to his <em>Trionfo
della Morte</em> (1894), D’Annunzio enters into the question
of the adequacy of the Italian language to express modern
ideas, which he emphatically asserts. There is no respect,
he declares, in which it need envy other tongues, or
anything that it need wish to borrow from them. The
misfortune is that its great resources are neglected by
modern writers, whose ordinary vocabulary is limited to
a few hundred words, many of illegitimate extraction or
hopelessly disfigured by vulgar usage, and these thrown
into sentences of nearly uniform length, destitute of
logical connection and of the rhythmical accompaniment
indispensable to a fine style. The remedy is a return to
the old authors; and, justly remarking that the novelists
of the best period are entirely out of harmony with
modern requirements by reason of their wholly objective
character and incapacity for psychological analysis,
D’Annunzio seriously advises modern romancers to enrich
their vocabulary and perfect their style by a course of the
ancient ascetic, casuistical, and devotional writers. The
Zolas of modern Italy resorting for instruction to St.
Catherine of Siena would indeed afford a scene for
Aristophanes; yet from a merely stylistic point of view
the advice is judicious.</p>

<p>As regards the ancient writers, the effect would be to
renovate them instead of rendering them more archaic,
as anticipated by Symonds, so far at least as concerns
their vocabulary. Although perhaps an inevitable tribute
to Time and Evolution, it is yet no gain to the English
language or literature that so much of our early writers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[Pg 416]</span>
should be obsolete; and Italy would do well to preserve
as much as possible the speech of the original masters of
her tongue, which can be best effected by keeping their
phraseology in constant employment. It may be hoped
that a standard of taste will thus be created enabling
writers to deal satisfactorily with the mass of neologisms
which the great development of modern civilisation
renders it impossible to exclude, but which, indiscriminately
admitted, threaten to swamp and debase the
national speech, or possibly to sunder the common inheritance
into two languages, one for the scholar, the
other for the multitude. It is, indeed, a most serious
problem for patriotic scholars in all nations how to
preserve the continuity of the national speech amid
the vicissitudes of the national life, and the tendencies
which in the intellectual as in the physical sphere are
always at work to wear all diversities down to one
monotonous level. The consolation is that, whereas
these agencies are mere unconscious forces, called into
being by causes independent of the human will, the
resisting influences have their origin in the will, and are
capable of intelligent direction. It should be the task of
the cultivators of every literature to ascertain what course
this literature has instinctively shaped for itself; what
are the dominant ideas which have determined the
course of its development. In Italy, from the first
lyrists down to Carducci, from the first prose writers
down to D’Annunzio, the guiding principle would seem
to have been the love of perfect form and artistic finish,
liable, like all other meritorious tendencies, to abuse,
when its too exclusive pursuit has cramped originality;
to aberration, when writers, remembering the end,
have mistaken the means; but on the whole a right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[Pg 417]</span>
and laudable aim, because in harmony with the genius
of the people and the language. As it has been said that
what is not clear is not French, so it might be added
that what is not refined is not Italian.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the production of much inferior
work, this character still appertains to the literature
in its best contemporary examples, the only ones with
which posterity is likely to concern itself. The enormous
recent development, nevertheless, of the sphere
of human interests; the creation of new arts and
sciences, necessitating a corresponding expansion of
the resources of language; the facility of intercourse
among peoples, tending to a cosmopolitanism which
continually threatens to obliterate national distinctions;
the formation of an immense and imperfectly trained
reading class, to whose tastes the majority of authors
must or at all events will condescend&mdash;these are trying
circumstances for every literature, and especially for
one whose special claims are polish and dignity. But
if it be true that these latter qualities are not imported,
or imposed by external pressure, but inherent in the
constitution of the nation itself, it may well be hoped
that they will adapt themselves to the circumstances of
the present, without breach of continuity with the past.
Up to the present time this continuity appears to us
unbroken, and we have been able to conceive of the history
of Italian literature as biography, not so much of
individual writers as of a single fair spirit living through
them all, which has moulded, animated, and laid aside all
in their turn. Like other finite existences, this spirit has
known infancy, adolescence, and maturity, and must one
day know decay and death; but the phenomena accompanying
her present development seem to us rather to
indicate that, in common with other literatures, she is
traversing a crisis than that she is entering upon a period
of decadence. Every age of letters has its own peculiar
peril: that of ours is the debasement of the standard of
writing to the level of imperfectly educated readers.
Against this danger Italian literature should be especially
protected by its close affinity to the languages of antiquity,
by uniform practice and tradition ever since Dante
called Love <em>the fountain of fair speech</em><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, and by a refinement
so deeply imbibed that it seems to have become a
part of itself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>



<p>The number of books which may be usefully consulted on various
points of Italian literature is very considerable. Only the most
important can be named here, and those for the most part such
as are written in English or Italian, and fall strictly under the
heads of literary history or bibliography, or standard editions with
indispensable commentaries. Many books not referable to any
of these classes, such as Burckhardt’s <em>Cicerone</em>, Des Brosses’s
<em>Letters</em>, or Dennistoun’s <em>Lives of the Dukes of Urbino</em>, are incidentally
of high value, but cannot be enumerated in a bibliographical
list. Some few biographies, however, have been added
which may be deemed essential. The dates given are in general
those of the best or most accessible editions. Some of the most
important are out of print.</p>


<h3>GENERAL COLLECTIONS OF ITALIAN AUTHORS</h3>

<p>D’Ancona and Bacci, <em>Manuale della Letteratura italiana</em>, 5 vols.
1893-95. A most admirable selection, both for its soundness of judgment
and its comprehensiveness. The notices of the various authors
prefixed to the selections are excellent from the biographical and
bibliographical points of view, and also from the critical when criticism
is sufficiently full, which is not always the case.&mdash;Cantù, <em>La Letteratura
italiana esposta</em>, &amp;c., 1851, and Morandi, <em>Antologia</em>, 1893, are
inferior to D’Ancona and Bacci, yet deserve attention.</p>


<h3>GENERAL HISTORIES</h3>

<p>Tiraboschi, <em>Storia della Letteratura italiana</em>, &amp;c., 1822. The
Italian literary historian <em>par excellence</em>, characterised at pp. 295, 296
of this book. There is a continuation by Lombardi.&mdash;Sismondi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[Pg 420]</span>
<em>Histoire de la Littérature du Midi de l’Europe</em>; numerous editions
and translations, but hardly equal to its reputation.&mdash;Ginguené, <em>Histoire
littéraire d’Italie</em>, 14 vols., 1811-35 [the last four volumes by
Salfi]. A work of extraordinary diligence and erudition, on no account
to be neglected by the few who may have time to read it, though
written from an eighteenth-century point of view now entirely antiquated.
The chief literary defect is the immoderate space devoted to
unravelling the plots of uninteresting epics and dramas; this excess
of diligence, however, renders it a valuable source of information
concerning minor authors frequently omitted.&mdash;This is also a valuable
feature of Corniani, <em>I Secoli della Letteratura italiana</em>, 1832-33.&mdash;Bartoli,
<em>Storia della Letteratura italiana</em>, 1875. This unfinished work
is the best authority for the history of the early period, beyond which
it does not as yet extend. It is full of learning and research, but
prolix.&mdash;Gaspary, <em>Geschichte der italienischen Litteratur</em>, &amp;c., 1885.
Another important work unfortunately left incomplete, breaking off in
the Cinque Cento. The best of all the larger Italian literary histories,
but deficient in form, rather a quarry of material than a regular edifice.
An English translation by H. Oelsner is in preparation.</p>


<h3>HISTORIES OF SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS</h3>

<p>Crescimbeni, <em>Istoria della volgar Poesia</em>, 1730. Quadrio, <em>Della
Storia e della regione d’ogni Poesia</em>, 1739-52. Standard histories
long out of print, but to be found in all good public libraries.&mdash;Muratori,
<em>Della perfetta Poesia</em>, 1821. Characterised at p. 295.&mdash;Ruth,
<em>Geschichte der italienischen Poesie</em>, 1844-47.&mdash;Loise, <em>Histoire de
la Poésie en Italie</em>, 1895.&mdash;Carducci, <em>Studi Letterari</em>, 1880. Valuable
criticisms on various periods of Italian literature.&mdash;An excellent
anthology of the dicta of modern Italian critics has been compiled by
Morandi, <em>Antologia</em>, &amp;c., 1893.</p>


<h3>ABRIDGED LITERARY HISTORIES</h3>

<p>Emiliani-Giudici, <em>Compendia della Storia della Letteratura italiana</em>,
1855. Very sound, but verbose.&mdash;Settembrini, <em>Lezioni della Letteratura
italiana</em>, 1877. Perhaps on the whole the most recommendable
of all the minor Italian literary histories. The author, an exile lately
restored to his country, is inspired with a spirit of patriotism which
renders his work singularly vital and energetic, and the young men
to whom his lectures are addressed are ever before him. Notwith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[Pg 421]</span>standing
occasional paradoxes, his appreciations are in general sound,
although he is naturally inclined to bear hardly upon authors who fail
to attain his standard of patriotism.&mdash;De Sanctis, <em>Storia della Letteratura
italiana</em>, 1879. Very good, but deficient in the spirit and
fire of Settembrini.&mdash;Fenini, <em>Letteratura italiana</em>, 1889. The model of
an abbreviated handbook; and the same may be said of its English
counterpart, Snell’s <em>Primer of Italian Literature</em>, 1893.</p>


<h3>POPULAR POETRY</h3>

<p>Rubieri, <em>Storia della Poesia popolare italiana</em>, 1877.&mdash;D’Ancona, <em>La
Poesia popolare italiana</em>, 1878.&mdash;Tommaseo, <em>Canti popolari</em>, 1841-42.&mdash;Tigri,
<em>Canti popolari Toscani</em>, 1869. See also J. A. Symonds’s essay
in his <em>Italian Sketches and Studies</em>, 1879, a new edition of which is in
preparation.</p>


<h3>PREDECESSORS AND CONTEMPORARIES OF DANTE</h3>

<p>Rossetti, <em>Dante and his Circle</em>, 1893. Consists chiefly of translations
of the highest merit. The information it contains is chiefly derived
from Nannucci, <em>Manuale della Letteratura del primo Secolo</em>, 1843;
and Trucchi, <em>Poesie italiane inedite di dugento autori</em>, 1846.</p>


<h3>DANTE</h3>

<p>There is, perhaps, as much commentary upon Dante as upon all the
rest of Italian literature put together. The most charming edition,
when comment is not needed, is that of Dr. Edward Moore,
1894, where all Dante’s works are compressed into one small and
exquisitely printed volume; but few students can dispense with a
commentary, and it is generally advisable to read Dante in a modern
Italian edition, with notes in that language. Of several excellent
editions of this description, the best, perhaps, is Fraticelli’s, 1892.
For profound students, Ferrazzi, <em>Manuale Dantesco</em>, 1865, and Poletto,
<em>Dizionario Dantesco</em>, 1885, are indispensable. A similar and not less
important work in English, by Mr. Paget Toynbee, is now in the
press. Of the numerous introductions to the <em>Divine Comedy</em>, the
following may be recommended to English readers: Scartazzini,
<em>Companion to Dante</em>, translated by A. J. Butler, 1895; Symonds,
<em>Introduction to Dante</em>, 1890; Maria Francesca Rossetti, <em>A Shadow
of Dante</em>, 1884; Dean Church, <em>Dante</em>, 1878; and A. J. Butler, <em>Dante</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[Pg 422]</span>
1895. Of these, Scartazzini is the scholar and Dantophilist, Symonds
and Butler are the efficient critics from the modern point of view, and
Miss Rossetti and Dean Church represent Dante’s own position.
Moore’s <em>Studies in Dante</em>, now in course of publication, and Wicksteed’s
<em>Sermons on Dante</em>, have a wider scope than that of an introductory
manual. The point of Dante’s influence on posterity has
been investigated by Oelsner, <em>Influence of Dante on Modern Thought</em>,
1895; and his relation to his own countrymen is discussed in the
third volume of Dean Plumptre’s translation of the <em>Divine Comedy</em>.
He is treated from the neo-catholic point of view by Ozanam, <em>Dante et
la Philosophie catholique</em>, 1845.</p>

<p>The best editions of Dante’s lyrical poems, including the very
many falsely attributed to him, and of his <em>Vita Nuova</em> and other
prose works, are those by Fraticelli. The best English translation of
the <em>Vita Nuova</em> is Rossetti’s; but other translators (Martin, 1862;
Norton, 1893; Boswell, 1895; and the Austrian translator Federn,
1897) have done much more for the illustration of the text. A
beautiful work on <em>Dante, sein Leben und sein Werk, sein Verhältniss
zur Kunst und zur Politik</em>, by Franz Xaver Kraus, has just been
published in Berlin.</p>


<h3>PETRARCH</h3>

<p>No authority for Petrarch’s life is equal to his own letters, published
complete in the edition of Fracassetti, 1859-63. An English translation
has been announced. There are recent biographies corresponding
to the requirements of modern research by Geiger, 1874, and in the
first volume of Koerting’s <em>Geschichte der Litteratur Italiens</em>, 1878.
Petrarch’s position and resources as a scholar have been thoroughly
investigated by Pierre de Nolhac, <em>Pétrarque et l’Humanisme</em>, 1892.
The best commentary is Leopardi’s, always printed with the current
Florentine edition of the <em>Canzoniere</em>. The most critical edition is
Mestica’s, 1896. The best literary criticism is Zumbini’s <em>Studi sul
Petrarca</em>, 1895.</p>


<h3>BOCCACCIO</h3>

<p>Koerting’s life of Boccaccio in the second volume of his <em>Geschichte</em>
is the best; and the English reader may consult Symonds, <em>Giovanni
Boccaccio</em>, 1895.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[Pg 423]</span></p>


<h3>ITALIAN NOVEL</h3>

<p>Perhaps the fullest account of the Italian novelists in an English
book is that in Dunlop’s <em>History of Fiction</em>, as edited by Wilson,
1888. See also Papanti, <em>Catalogo dei Novelieri italiani</em>, 1871, and the
notices prefixed to the specimens translated in Thomas Roscoe’s <em>Italian
Novelists</em>, 1832.</p>


<h3>ITALIAN DRAMA</h3>

<p>The fullest accounts of individual Italian dramatists will be found
in Ginguené. The beginning of the Italian drama is investigated
by D’Ancona in his <em>Origini del Teatro in Italia</em>, 1891; see also the
volumes (iv.-vii.) devoted to Italy in Klein’s <em>Geschichte des Dramas</em>.
D’Ancona has written a monograph on the <em>Sacre Rappresentazioni</em>
(see p. 226). The <em>Commedia dell’ Arte</em> (pp. 305-307) is treated in
Scherillo’s monograph with this title, in Maurice Sand’s <em>Masques et
Bouffons</em>, and in Symonds’s preface to his translation of the memoirs
of Carlo Gozzi, 1892.</p>


<h3>ROMANTIC POETRY</h3>

<p>This subject is most fully treated in general histories, whether of
Italian or romantic literature. Panizzi’s introduction to his edition
of Boiardo and Ariosto (1831), though in many respects erroneous or
antiquated, deserves attention, as does Ferrario, <em>Storia ed Analisi
degli antichi Romanzi di Cavalleria</em>, 1828-29. Ariosto’s indebtedness
to earlier romancers has been investigated by Rajna, <em>Le Fonti dell’
Orlando Furioso</em>. Leigh Hunt’s <em>Stories from the Italian Poets</em> is a
charming companion to Italian chivalric poetry.</p>


<h3>ITALIAN RENAISSANCE</h3>

<p>The best view of the Renaissance as a whole is to be obtained from
Symonds’s great work, <em>The Renaissance in Italy</em>, 1875-81. A new
edition is in course of issue. Much of this comprehensive book relates
to politics, and much to art; but so complete in the Renaissance period
was the interpenetration of all forms of mental activity that no part
of the work is useless for the study of literature. The same may be
said of almost all modern biographies of leading Italians of the period,
of most collections of letters, and of such books as Bisticci’s memoirs
of his contemporaries (p. 107). A useful abridged account of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[Pg 424]</span>
scholars of the early period of the Renaissance will be found in
Villari’s <em>Life of Machiavelli</em>; and authors of later date are noticed
in Roscoe’s<cite>Life of Leo X</cite>. The dissemination of literature upon the
invention of printing is illustrated by Horatio Brown in his<cite>Venetian
Printing Press</cite>, 1892.</p>


<h3>TASSO</h3>

<p>All previous biographies are superseded by Solerti’s, 1895.</p>


<h3>EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Crescimbeni,<cite>Vite degl’ Arcadi Illustri</cite>, 1704-13.&mdash;Cantù,<cite>L’Abate
Parini e la Lombardia nel Secolo XVIII</cite>.&mdash;Carducci,<cite>Parini</cite>.&mdash;Vernon
Lee,<cite>Studies of the Eighteenth Century in Italy</cite>, 1880. Much
of this brilliant book is devoted to music and the stage, but the literary
element is never long absent.</p>


<h3>NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>The most valuable essays on Italian literature in the nineteenth
century are at present to be found in periodicals, especially the
<cite>Nuova Antologia</cite> and the<cite>Deutsche Rundschau</cite>; in general works on
Italy like Mariotti’s; in the biographies and correspondence of distinguished
authors of the period, and in such monographs upon them
as Zumbini’s<cite>Sulle Poesie di Vincenzo Monti</cite>. Modern Italian poetry
is well treated by W. D. Howells,<cite>Modern Italian Poets</cite>, 1887; by
F. Sewall in his introduction to his translations from Carducci, 1892;
and in the preface and biographical introductions to Greene’s<cite>Italian
Lyrists of To-Day</cite>, 1893.</p>

<div class="small1">

<p class="p1"><b><em>The Times.</em></b>&mdash;“A sketch to which the much-abused word 'brilliant’
may be justly applied. Dealing in 400 pages with a subject which is both
immense and well worn, Mr. Murray presents us with a treatment at once
comprehensive, penetrating, and fresh. By dint of a clear, freely-moving
intelligence, and by dint also of a style at once compact and lucid, he has
produced a book which fairly represents the best conclusions of modern
scholarship.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Athenæum.</em></b>&mdash;“The book is brilliant and stimulating; while its
freshness of treatment and recognition of the latest German research amply
justify its existence. Professor Murray has made these old Greek bones
live.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Saturday Review.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse’s introduction to this new
series, the list of his collaborators, his own wide knowledge and delicate
taste, and, finally, the manner in which his first volume is executed, all
assure us that whatever high hopes he may raise, we need have no fear of
their ample fulfilment. Mr. Murray’s style is vigorous, and, above all, he
has the gift of sympathy for the Greek spirit. He is distinguished alike
for fascination and thoroughness: he commands both our confidence and
our admiration.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Morning Post.</em></b>&mdash;“Professor Murray is exceptionally qualified
to deal with the difficult and important subject of that Greek Literature,
which he has made a life-long study. His gifts of imaginative sympathy
with ancient Greece, and his exact knowledge of her literature, are distinctly
evidenced in this volume. In dealing with the tragic poets, with
Herodotus, Demosthenes, and the lyric poets, Professor Murray has brought
to notice much that will prove new even to the scholar, and more that will
be of interest to the general reader.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[Pg 441]</span></p>

<p><b><em>The Scotsman.</em></b>&mdash;“The book speaks well for the attractions of
its own subject, and promises well for the series in which it appears.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Daily Chronicle.</em></b>&mdash;“The writer shows himself well qualified to
write an illuminating history of Greek Literature, in which learning is
enlivened and supplemented by literary skill, by a true sense of the
humanities. The reader feels that this is no book of perfunctory erudition,
but a labour of love, performed by a scholar, to whom ancient Greece and
her literature are exceedingly real and vivid. His judgments and suggestions
are full of a personal, fresh sincerity.”</p>


<p><b><em>The Glasgow Herald.</em></b>&mdash;“To competent knowledge of his subject,
Mr. Murray adds a power of exposition which does not always accompany
great learning; and, while scholars will here find a fresh and well-digested
account of all the most recent criticism of the long procession of outstanding
names in Greek literature, the ordinary reader will not be repelled by
excessive technicality or too numerous details.”</p>

<p><b><em>The St. James’s Gazette.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse is to be congratulated on
having invited Professor Murray to write the first volume of this series.
If the other contributors do their work as well, the success of the venture
is assured. He has done no slight service to the cause of real learning as
distinguished from superficial culture, and he has invested his treatise with
a human interest. The book is equally solid and attractive, and abounds
with happy phrases.”</p>

<p><b><em>The National Observer and British Review.</em></b>&mdash;“The treatment
of the Homeric question seems to us masterly, as an indication of the results
attained by scientific analysis of language and the comparative study
of early literatures.... For scholars and lovers of Greek, Professor
Murray’s summary but penetrating criticism will have the charm that is
always exercised by a powerful and original mind discoursing on subjects
delightful to the listener.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Speaker.</em></b>&mdash;“Vigour and freshness, great learning and independence
of judgment, are the salient characteristics of Mr. Murray’s book.
He has produced a work which, while it puts the English student abreast
of all the latest work in classical research, may be read with pleasure by
those who have not carried their classical studies beyond the point they
reached at school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[Pg 442]</span></p>

<p><b><em>A. T. Q. C. in the Speaker.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Heinemann and Mr. Gosse
have made a brilliant start in this Series. To condense into some 400
boldly printed pages a story which is not only vast and intricate in itself,
but has been complicated by the discussions and theories of more than two
thousand years, and to do this without ignoring those discussions and
theories, must have been a daunting task. Mr. Murray has accomplished
it, and an even more difficult feat. He has written an eminently readable
book.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Pall Mall Gazette.</em></b>&mdash;“A really quite admirable book. It is
full of learning, but the learning is never obtruded. Then, too, it is full
of humour, not exactly racy epigram, but felicitous phrases. The style,
indeed, is not the least attractive part of the book. We must also say a
word of praise for the translated extracts throughout the book. They are
finely selected, accurately rendered, and clothed in really thrilling English.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Journal of Education.</em></b>&mdash;“The series starts <em>felici omine</em>. No
brighter or more readable account of a subject so immense as Greek
literature has, to our knowledge, ever been published in English than
Professor Murray’s volume.... This delightful book should be of great
service.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Spectator.</em></b>&mdash;“Professor Murray soon convinces his readers that
he is equal to his subject, has something fresh to say about it, and is able to
say it with a quite uncommon vigour. In power of sympathy he surpasses,
we think, all his predecessors. We have seldom found a book that has
given us more pleasure than this.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Standard.</em></b>&mdash;“Professor Murray does all the justice which is
possible in the compass of 400 pages, to a subject so vast, subtle, and
many-sided. He has written a lucid and fascinating sketch of the men
and movements that shaped in prose and poetry the most splendid and
influential literary bequest of antiquity. The method of the book is to
realise what sort of men the Greek poets, historians, orators, and philosophers
were, and to describe them in their habit as they lived. The book
abounds in fresh and vigorous thought, and independence of judgment.”</p>

<p class="center big3 p2"><big>A History of French Literature</big></p>

<p class="p1 center">By</p>

<p class="center p2 big2">Edward Dowden, D.C.L., LL.D.</p>

<p class="center big1">Professor of Oratory and English Literature in the<br />
University of Dublin</p>

<p class="center p2">Large crown 8vo, cloth extra, <a href="#Page_6">6</a>s.</p>

<div class="small1">

<p class="p1"><b><em>The Athenæum.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Dowden has condensed a remarkable amount
of carefully formed judgments into his 400 pages. He has done it with so
honest an intelligence that we can trust him alike when he writes of
Rabelais and when he writes of Fénelon.... The book gives us a
clearer and a more sympathetic notion of the spirit of French writers than
any book, certainly which has been written in English.... Mr. Dowden
is for the most part so just, because, whatever his personal preferences, he
possesses pre-eminently a sane enthusiasm for literature as literature.
Looking at literature as the self-expression of humanity, he is most attracted
by those writers in whom what is called the human element is strongest....
Where his book is most valuable, most corrective of much that is
unduly academic in the professional treatment of literature, is that he has
realised literature in this living way, as being itself so living a thing....
A book which is certainly the best history of French Literature in the
English language.”</p>

<p><b><em>The Saturday Review.</em></b>&mdash;“This is a history of literature as histories
of literature should be written. From beginning to end of this book, in
which French Literature is chronicled from the Middle Ages to the end of
the first half of the nineteenth century, there is not a page in which the
writer is not seen successfully endeavouring to understand, sympathise
with, and truthfully interpret writer after writer, Rabelais, Calvin, Victor
Hugo.... His style has the singular merit of being a living voice, speaking
to us with gravity and enthusiasm about the writers of many ages, and
of being a human voice always.... Seeing sharply, definitely, he sees
widely; and that moral quality, whose importance in literature he is so
well aware of, gives to his own writing a grasp on realities, on what is
essential in a man’s expression of himself, which the historian of literature
but rarely possesses.... The more closely one looks into this book, the
more clearly is it seen how much thought, how much mental selection, as
well as how much reading, have gone to the making of these picturesque
portraits of writers.”</p>

<p class="center p2">Large crown 8vo, cloth extra, 6s.</p>

<div class="small1">

<p class="p1"><b><em>Athenæum.</em></b>&mdash;“The author has succeeded in giving a really useful
account of the whole process of evolution in English letters&mdash;an account
based upon a keen sense at once of the unity of his subject and of the
rhythm of its ebb and flow; and illumined by an unexampled felicity in
hitting off the leading characteristics of individual writers, ”placing“ them
critically in a few graceful lines. As a whole the book is full of insight
and serenity of judgment.”</p>

<p><b><em>Literature.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse possesses a rare power of giving adequacy
even to his most summarised accounts of literary work, and his most rapid
sketches of literary figures. He is always master of the vivid, picturesque,
or humorous phrase which lives in the memory, and imprints on it the
personality of the author, whom it depicts with a stroke. This 'History
of Modern English Literature’ is a work which will not only serve its
purpose in the class-room, but is eminently worthy of a place of honour in
the library.”</p>

<p><b><em>Saturday Review.</em></b>&mdash;“It is difficult to be too thankful to a historian
who judges everything from the strictly literary point of view, to whom the
word history really means a tracing of the continuous life of literature,
and to whom the historian himself is a person to be kept rigorously out
of sight.”</p>

<p><b><em>Times.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse’s most ambitious book, and probably his best. It
bears on every page the traces of wide reading, of a genuine love for his
subject, and of a lively critical intelligence. Moreover, it is extremely
readable&mdash;more readable, in fact, than any other single volume dealing with
the subject that we can call to mind. The picture given is in the main
true to life, and it is painted with extreme dexterity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[Pg 445]</span></p>

<p><b><em>Daily Chronicle.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse has been remarkably successful in
bringing into focus and proportion the salient features of his vast and
varied theme. We have read the book, not only with pleasure, but with a
singular emotion. The very rapidity with which the majestic procession
of names passed in review, brought home to us with peculiar vividness
the greatness of the phenomenon comprised in the words ”English Literature.“
Mr. Gosse’s criticism is generally sympathetic, but at the same time
it is always sober.”</p>

<p><b><em>Daily Graphic.</em></b>&mdash;“Mr. Gosse is a careful student and skilful critic;
he knows the subject as well as any one, and he knows how to write something
better than a school-book. We wish we could help our readers to
enjoy to the full this most delightful book, which every one should read
from beginning to end.”</p>

<p><b><cite>St. James’s Gazette.</cite></b>&mdash;“Certainly one of the most valuable as well
as one of the most interesting books of its kind.”</p>

<p><b><cite>Academy.</cite></b>&mdash;“A book that is interesting in every paragraph.”</p>

<p><b><cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></b>&mdash;“Animation, sympathy, proportion, govern
the book throughout. Alike in his treatment of individuals and in his firm
hold of the main threads of his story, the author shows his mastery of the
art of weaving a history.”</p>

<p><b><cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></b>&mdash;“This brilliant book gives a new value and distinction
to the series. Mr. Gosse’s critical taste and skill have never been
better exemplified. The book is a fine and solid piece of work.”</p>

<p><b><cite>Manchester Courier.</cite></b>&mdash;“An interesting body of criticism unsurpassed
in its sanity, luminousness, and sense of proportion, expressed with a directness
and clearness which render it all the more valuable, and with a felicity
which gives it a charm, rarely associated with handbooks of literature.”</p>

<p><b><cite>Globe.</cite></b>&mdash;“It is wonderful that Mr. Gosse should have been able to get
so much fact as well as thought into a space comparatively so small. We
have here, in effect, the cream of the author’s meditations on the wide
field of English literature.”</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
